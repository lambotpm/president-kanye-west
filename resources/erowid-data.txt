Finally friday arrives, i bought my 30$ mercedes xtc pill. I've been so psyched for this. I decided to take the pill at my friends house. I was nervous so i took half a pill and plenty of water so i did not overheat. Walked to his house which was about 20 minute walk. I got to his house, i was still not feeling it, i was very upset because i thought it was a dud. After 45 minutes from takin the first half, i took the second and boy was that a good idea! 15 minutes after the second half was ingested, the first effects hit me lightly. I began to feel relaxed all over, slight numbness, no mental effects yet. 10 minutes after that i got a rush of energy and began to get up run around and just shooting hoops. I tell my friend i need a cigarette, so we go outside to smoke one. after smoking my cigarette, we begin to walk down the street for some fresh air, thats when i knew i was in for the best time of my life. The grass beneath my feet on his yard felt like a pillow and cushioned my walking. Then we began to walk down the road, and as we are walking i just stop sit down in the sunlight. I needed to go into the sunlight, he tried to make me go further down and i had a temper tantrum. so we sat, and i began to go on and on about what a nice day it was, the sun was out, blue sky, birds chirping, 45 degrees and was just enjoying life. 

30 min after the second half... Physical effects by this time are complete relaxness, it was hard to walk! No metal effets. Some visual distortion such as my friend bouncing around when he actually just stood there. we walk back into the house then i was real mentally and physically fucked up. I sat down and was falling and swaying left and right, my mind was running in all directions shooting out questions like. ' why am i here?' why did i do this? does my friend hate me? do my parents hate me? and whole body was completely light feeling. i almost had to throw up it was so intense and scary. 

15 minutes after this scary ordeal i begin to settle down, i layed down inside his warm house on the rug, touching and rubbing my hands like everywhere, everything was orgasmic feeling. I took a look at my eyes, i look like satan! it was so cool! Then after about and hour laying on the floor, other people come to his house who i dont even really know, but i just conversed with them with no feeling of stupidity, embarresment or consequences, very cool, i loved it, an hour later my eyes still were dialated but effects were over, it was fantastic






At first it was just another rave with my crew.  Drop a little E, have a good night.  What I didn't know was this was going to be one rave I probably won't ever forget, what I can remember that is.  

We started out the night reaching the 'club' around midnight.  Didn't have the drugs when we got there but that wasn't a problem.  I found a buddy of mine and dropped a couple of tabs of orange motorolla.  Good way to start the night, rolling for a few hours sounds good after the week of work I've had.  I waited around with my crew for a while, didn't seem to be getting the effects as quickly as usual.  Didn't stress, not all tabs work the same, right.  Decided to step out and have a smoke, my buddy steps out and he's pissed.  He dropped a tab at the same time I did and he wasn't feeling anything.  I calmed him down and convinced him to wait a while before finding the dealer and starting something ugly.  I had a couple of smokes then headed back in.  It was unusually hot on the floor tonight so I had a seat next to the door to chill for a while.  No effects, backs feeling a little better though.

One of my friends who had never tried E before tonight wandered over to me.  He's rolling, wearing a mask and looking like he's having a good time.  He takes the mask off and shoves it in my face, the icy vapors coming off the mask mean only one thing, one thing that I seemed to overlook, Vicks vapor rub.  This is what I had been missing.  I inhaled deeply and that was where my night really started.  Couldn't quite tell if it was just light headedness or the E kicking in, until a few minutes had passed.  Yes, my roll had begun.

I was in tune with the music as usual.  All my movements were fluid and everything felt right.  Something wasn't quite right though, the beat was moving fast enough that I should have been bustin' out on the floor.  No matter what I tried I couldn't get more than a slide out of my body.  I decided to go have a seat and enjoy the music.  That was definately feeling better.  I was actually looking forward to putting in a full night of dancing but it was starting to look like a mellow trip tonight.  This probably influenced a lot of what happened later.

I was peaking and I found myself sitting in the back on a pool table with movement all around me.  I had smoked some weed and was feeling pretty calm.  Next thing I know one of my buddies comes over and asks for twenty bucks.  He's good for it so I got no problems kickin' him a 20.  A little later, not sure how much time had passed, I've got a girl in my arms.  Not sure where she came from but I didn't mind.  My buddy comes back and hands me a little bag and a bottle of water.  I couldn't tell what was in the bag until I reached inside.  What did I feel?  The familiar roughness of those wonderful shrooms.  Normally I would have to know exactly what kind I'm taking here but at this point it doesn't seem to matter.  I take the mushrooms out and shove them in my mouth and take a large drink.  The mushrooms have the normal brackish flavor I'm used to.  I soften them up with the water, chew them up, and swallow them down.  The girl in my arms is already tripping off the 'house' acid her friend had given her earlier.  For some reason this feels very appropriate.  

Skipping ahead a bit.  My trip was much like my experience with E earlier.  The effects took their time to hit me.  I didn't realize I was trippin' till my friend with an incredibly elastic-like face, he's an actor, starts bobbing his head from side to side and shaking it very fast.  All of a sudden my friend is gone and there is a womans face on his head, her movements are jerky and strangely melodic at the same time.  Then she steps out of the light, when she steps back in my friend is back and he's smiling.  I can't do anything but smile back and sit back down on the pool table.  I'm trippin' and I'm trippin' hard.

The girl is back in my arms and she's kissing me.  Feels kinda weird, not quite like it should, feels good though.  Not too much comes to me from this point besides sitting down at a table with a pipe in my hand and taking a hit.  Doesn't quite taste the same as usual.  My buddy leans over and whispers 'opium' in my ear.  The whisper echoes through the vaults of my mind for a while, then I shrug and take another hit.  I'm still in total control but I'm just about to hit the edge and fling myself right off.  

Next thing I know the music stops,  somebody lifts the record off the table and the beat that has been invading my senses for the last 6 hours is gone.  People are coming around and picking up all the chairs.  It's time to go outside and face whatever reality has to throw at me.  I get into the car with 3 people that I can truly say are three of the best people I have ever known.  I drive to my buddy's house and we get out walk through the house and into the garage.  My friends roomate and girlfriend are asleep in the house, gotta keep it down so they don't wake up.  It's about 6:30 a.m. now.  We sit in a circle in the garage and talk about the previous events leading up to the moment.  My friend who had never done E before was happy, he would like to try it again.  He is a part of the experience now.  

Another of my friends is sitting next to me and looks a little stressed.  He has been grinding his teeth all night, he was previously addicted to crystal meth and recognizes the grinding as a possible effect of that particular substance.  In the particular state I was in I had forgotten about the fact that I had been grinding my teeth all night as well.  I passed it off, I know the risks of taking E, sometimes you get a few things in that little pill that you don't know about, not a problem.  We talk in that little circle for a couple of hours, my friends passing the bong while I smoke more cigarettes.  Cigarettes are tasting pretty good right now.  We decide to convene to the living room.  We're all talking about what we gotta do today.  It's about 10 a.m. now.  I know we're not going to get any of the things we are talking about done.  Soon, a couple of people have dropped off to sleep, it's just me and one other.  He gets up to turn the tv on, trying to keep it quiet for the roomate and girlfriend.  As soon as he hits the button the entire sound system fires up to a very deep bass tone.  Everybody is on their feet, cursing and running around.  My friend shuts the tv off and slouches deep into the couch.  Shouldn't have messed with the tv.  The boyfriend comes out of the room, bitches for a few seconds, more at his girlfriends insistance than anything.  I lay me head down on the pillow at my side, close my eyes and think one thought.  I wish I could remember more about that girl.

I'm calm and collected now.  I've reached a peace that I haven't know for a very, very long time.







I've rolled about 10 times before this experience, and none of them compared to this one time. Me and my girlfriend each took one buddha.  It took about 40min for it to hit me, It took her longer to feel the effects.  We were smoking a bob (Blunt, weed filled cigar...) about 30mins after we ate the pills.  Later i noticed that i was higher than a bob would get me, I knew i was rolling then.  It was all good, I was in a good place, my girlfriend's apartment.  I was with the person i loved, I was having fun talking to my girl about how we were feeling.  She seemed to be enjoying her roll also.  We had been listening to some Erykah Badu, One of our esential tripping/rolling music selections, I felt like changing the scene to see how i felt.  We put on a black light, That was tight! I felt calm and at peace with my soul and hers. Then we decided to turn off all the lights and light some candles. Bad Idea!  

With the lighting concept the way it was we started talking.  About 5 minutes later my mind started to wander, I was overwhelmed with guilt, and sorrow.  I felt like you do after you've been crying for days!  I was rambling some wierd nonsense, talking about my mom spanking me over her knee, and about never touching another human again... I don't remember anything i was saying but my girlfriend told me later what had happened.  I was feeling horrible, in my mind different random memories of my past were flashing by.  All bad memories, such as my dad dying, fights i've been in, being locked up in JDC (juvenile detention center), and other bad experiences i've had.  While each experience was flashing through my mind I could feel the pain, guilt, fear, pity, anger, and embarrasment each memory portrayed.  While stuck in my head tormenting, my girl was starting to panic, she could see that I was lost and turning down the wrong path.

I was still rambling absurdities and I as I looked into her eyes i could see my pain in her eyes, by this point I was fucking with her mind also, my situation was reaching to her, she started losing it too, I could see it in her eyes!
but before she got to deep into her thoughts, she asked me to turn the lights back on.  She had to say it about 4 times for it to register in my mind, finally i ripped myself apart from my thoughts, got up walked over to the lights... my feelings changed just then, I felt better, I still felt guilty like i'd done something terrible. I turned the lights on and sat down.  I was still disoriented, still rolling, but out of my bad memories. I got an intense headache and felt scared the rest of the night.  What had happened to me?  A bad trip?  but for only aboout 15 minutes I was lost. 

My girl said she was fully aware of what had happened.  She thought the light scheme helped me to lose it, the dark candle light lead me into my head, and that no other distractions like tv, music, and other things were keeping me from leaving.  When she asked me to turn the lights on it was a change of scenery and brought me back.

What was it about that light scheme that lead me down that path?

What made me feel such horrible feelings?

What would have happened to me if my girl didn't think quickly and didnt get me to turn the lights on?

Could I have brought her to where I was?








I have had the opportunity to try 2C-T-7 on three separate occasions; in a group setting at 30mg, alone at 30mg, and with my wife, Evenstar, at 37mg (she took 20).  Unlike some others, neither Evenstar nor I experienced any nausea from this material; and it should be noted that Evenstar has a tendency to become nauseous from MDMA.  All three experiences were some of the most positive psychedelic experiences I have ever had.

The group setting was quite enjoyable, spending time with like-minded friends who were all quite excited by the prospect of exploring this new material together.  The experience was quite empathogenic and heart warming all round.

The solo flight at 30mg was quite pleasant as well.  Being something of a hard head, I had no visuals at 30mg, and found it to be a pleasant, heart opening and heart warming material.  Some tiredness was noted the following day, but recovery was pretty uneventful.

Reading over the reports of intense visuals from other explorers, I decided to gradually inch the dose up to see if I could access that level with this material, as I am not especially prone to visuals.  Since I had had no visuals at 30, I chose to weigh up 37mg; a conservative addition of the magic number 7.  As the material began to ramp up, it became clear that the addition of the 7mg brought out quite another aspect of 2CT7; I was soon into some amazing visuals, images of interstellar sunrises, with sunlight gleaming around the edge of planetary bodies, which eventually converged on the emergence of a warm, intensely illuminating experience that was simultaneously a deep spiritual opening.  This was definitely one of those elusive +4 experiences.  Evenstar and I spent the day together pleasantly exploring the nature of this material and generally had a wonderful time together.  We slept well that night and woke up the next morning feeling very good.  Overall, this is now one of our favorite materials.  But it seems that a word of caution is in order as some people are apparently quite sensitive to this material and perhaps not prepared to be launched into a powerful entheogenic experience.  Be advised that this is one of the big ones!







Having read some accounts of nausea on 2-CT-7, I decided to take some on a full stomach.  I ingested 25-30mg in a capsule about 1 1/2 hours after a substantial meal, 10pm.  The full effects did not really come on until about two hours later. I resisted the impulse to boost, and I was glad I didn't once it came on.  

Initially I noticed some onset effects similar to mushrooms or LSD.  This was calmer than either and had a component to it that reminded me of ecstacy.  I would compare this most closely to a candyflip (ecstacy/acid combo), but a friend tells me this sounds a lot like 2CB.  Whatever, however, this is a lovely ride, calm and powerful, with plenty of closed-eye and open-eye visuals, and a strong connection to the here and now.  The trip lasted a solid 8 hours, with a long slow peak and descent.  Speaking of the visuals, I noticed that they had a different aesthetic than other compounds' visuals.  Whereas LSD is strongly kaleidoscopic, with overlaid patterns, and DMT is very pointy and elfin (no better terms come to mind), 2-CT-7 had a strong organic, morphy feel.  I saw (closed-eye) visions of alien living spaces, with silver skinned friendly people hanging out, glad to see me there.  They had impeccable taste.

I felt great until I fell asleep at 8am or so.  I was tired when I woke up, but not dissipated or stupid.

Overall, this was a VERY kind drug, and I will try it again.







This was not my first experiment with Morning Glory seeds but it was certainly the most effective and intense.  I had heard of and tried several different methods of preparing the seeds, such as soaking the seeds overnight and drinking the water, but I have found the easiest and most effective method for myself.  I made a trip to Wal Mart and picked up 36 packages of seeds, each containing an average of 50-60 seeds.  Figuring 3 packages or 150 seeds is a decent dose, I got 9 packages or 3 hits each of Heavenly Blue, Pearly Gates (white), Scarlet O'Hara (red) and mixed colors.  

I use Burpee brand instead of the dreaded Better Homes and Gardens brand, which are treated to induce nausea.  Burpee seeds are grown and packaged in Holland and or France, and it reflects upon these countries very different views on personal freedom and accountability. God bless Europeans. I have used Burpee's 4 times and have only gotten sick once, which in retrospect can be accounted to the fact that I ate a large meal just prior to consuming the seeds, which had been mixed with fruit juice for two days. I deserved what I got and was naive and disrespectful of the native Mezotech's rituals and practice of fasting and meditation in preparation for a spiritual journey (we owe our knowledge of the psychoactive properties of Morning Glories, Salvia Divinorum and Psilocybin mushrooms to these indigenous peoples).

For preparation I dumped the seeds separated by different kinds into bowls. I then placed them in a tight screened strainer and ran warm water over them for a minute or two to remove any dirt or other impurities, I let them dry on a flat screen over a kitchen exhaust fan.  I then put them in an electric coffee grinder to grind them up into a fine powder.  This requires vigorously shaking the coffee grinder in order to grind up the hard seed coats.  I was left with about 2 teaspoons ground seed matter per hit.  I had bought some OO sized gelatin capsules at a local health food store and dumped the ground seeds back into their bowls and packed them tightly into the capsules.  Each cap holds about 25 seeds worth so 6 caps=1 hit.

I went to the Fry street, music and arts festival in Denton Texas, which has a very large hippie community, and its no accident it's called Fry street.  I had fasted for about 12 hours overnight when I dropped for maximum effect but 2-3 hours is the minimum (and this is for people with pretty stable stomachs.) I took 5 caps of heavenly blue, my friend took 4 of Scarlet O'Hara on the way there and we smoked a joint to mellow us out for the trip and to relieve any nausea (even untreated seeds can make your stomach ache.)   I began to feel it after about 45 min, being in an uplifted mood but didn't notice any major perceptual changes for about 2 hours.  I peaked at around 4 hours.  I have found that morning glories do not have strong forceful visuals, and while this LSD effect can be reached it takes focus and concentration on this and not really a main desired effect for me, but the main hallucinogenic effect is the increased intensity of color and fascination with things of nature. I wandered around this cross cultural Mecca of sorts seeing people of every different corner of a vast counterculture, and felt the harmony of the universe and humanities place in the sun, seeing our species potential for love and creating beauty. I spent a lot of time watching couples together and analyzing opposite sex relations with a new clarity and insight.  I was perfectly content wandering by myself, but was not at all anti social and engaged in much conversation with my friends who were there. I gave 6 caps each to my friend and his brother but only the one who was less experienced with LSD felt the effects to be stronger than the pot we smoked after they dropped. I gave another friend who had until just the past month seriously smoked pot 2 caps; his only effect was being in an uplifted mood.

I was definitely in a mystical state for about 3 hours when I decided I wanted to take it up a notch and took 4 more caps. I smoked some kind bud, which was very potent and tasted like a pine forest in my mouth.  Just after this was my peak, which very abruptly turned from euphoria, to pain. I had been walking aimlessly through the crowd, feeling a little alone when I stopped for some reason.  I wasn't even looking ahead and stood there for about 5 minutes before I realized I had stopped right by my friends brother who I just met and couldn't have recognized from behind in a crowd of about 12,000 he was having a good trip, and I was fine. I was watching a loud punkish band Baboon, on the main stage, when I began concentrating on the powerful pounding bass from the speakers.  I play bass and can take a lot of noise, but this was too much. I could feel my skull pulsating and vibrating to the tones and I thought I felt the molecular structure of my brain begin to break up and thought I was going to throw up, so I managed a 'I just have to leave' and stumbled away from the sound.  

The time from when I left to when I saw a familiar face was an eternity, and I found that I had emotionally regressed to the state of an infant, wanting only the most familiar female face and comfort.  It was a very good test of my ability to handle strong psychoactive drugs, and having only taken LSD at the half a hit level, and my current dose being 2.5 times the amount of morning glories as I had last taken, but I didn't lose it and found the friend I came with who has gone off and had a blast all day meeting new people and bar hoping.  I didn't want to bring her down but needed someone to talk to I trusted her the most.  When I left it was the last band playing and by the time I had gotten my head together enough to move about it was getting dark.  I spent the next 2 hours wandering around Denton with her as the police shut Fry street down for the year.  We both were on an emotional roller coaster and it took everything I had to get her to decide that she needed to come back home.

The drive home was a little difficult, and I had to request conversation be kept to a minimum, and was really ready to get someplace safe and familiar. Looking back the fair had been like total freedom and worry free and I didn't notice how far into it I was, but it was much harder to handle simple tasks and responsibilities such as getting to the car. My attention span was horrible, but we got back to her house and invited a few friends to come over we took some more seeds.  I took 3 more caps, and this is when I had my most intense visuals being too worn out to do mush else but lay on the couch.  I saw movement in the patterns on the cloth of the couch, and the plant atop the TV stand was swaying and flowing as if it were underwater, anyway this whole experience lasted about ten hours on 500 seeds, and was for the majority of the trip extremely fantastic, beautiful and introspective, even the bad trip was good in that I maintained the ability to bring myself to the surface.
 
That day eight people took them using a standard dosage and method, no one got sick, and all had a 'Gloryous' time.  I believe that with Morning Glories as with Cannabis and other botanical hallucinogens, there is always a way out, not so true of manmade chemicals, which are not in harmony with your natural neurochemistry.  This is why I don't say fry anymore in reference to the LSA experience, its inaccurate and inappropriate.  Why not say  'I Bloomed.'







My first experience with the Mushroom. Along with two friends of mine, (both first-timers) I backpacked two days into a coastal wilderness area we had never been to before. Beach hiking on a black sand beach under sunny skies was a treat those first two days. We felt lucky to be travelling under such nice conditions since it was quite early in the season and rain was a likely event. On the evening of the second day we set up camp by a river, pitching our tent on the sand back by the green edge of the lush forest. The plan was to dose the next morning. We did not discuss the upcoming experience much but our fire-lit faces betrayed flickers of anticipation. My expectations coming to this point were unambiguously positive. I had much history with marijuana (which I have a peculiar sensitivity to) and had patiently prepared myself for an eventual encounter with mushrooms. 

In hindsight, I see two misconceptions I took into the trip with me. First, I think there is a general opinion that, in the spectrum of common entheogens, mushrooms fall immediately above marijuana. Having not heard any detailed account of the possible range of effects, I carried the notion in my head that I was in for something only slightly more intense than a very strong marijuana high. The second fallacy I brought with me was that pot would only make a mushroom trip come on quicker. I wasn't aware of the possibility of a synergistic effect. When we awoke at sunrise on the third day to dark gray skies, drizzling rain and cold wind, I should have perhaps treated it as an omen for the trip ahead.

We ate a small breakfast of granola and soy milk then huddled beneath a small driftwood shelter. Each of us ingested 3.5 grams of psilocybe cubensis, commenting on the extremely foul taste. We cleaned our camp up then waited for the effects to make themselves known. I split from my friends who wanted to go out near the ocean. The rain had increased to a light shower and I retreated a little ways under the shelter of the trees. I was aware of a stony effect and heightened interest in the lovely greenery around me. I bent down close to a small patch of tiny plants, moss and ferns. As I came down into this miniature scene, the delicate lifeforms seemed to swell into grand and beautiful versions of themselves. There seemed to be an entire world happening down in the bushes. I began to hear a strange music coming from, it seemed to me, the tiny plant system and my immediate surroundings. The sound of the rain dripping and circulating through the green botanical city made an almost digital-sounding high pitched oscillation. To my ears came plant music, oddly electronic. The scene took on a strange, futuristic light, as if I was looking at a small hydroponic grow-tank with artificial light shining from above and the sound of computerized sprayers hissing in the background. The plants themselves seemed half-artificial: genetically designed experiments or even computer-generated images. This imagery brought with it some cognitive development along a similar theme of artificial reality. The mushrooms seemed to slightly distance my awareness from my sensory perception and I began to think of reality as a fearfully complex game of virtual reality. Each plant seemed merely to be the physical expression of the algorithm for a plant. Every aspect of reality was simply programmed to look and behave with certain properties, just as a programmer would code a 3D world with plants, trees, running water, etc. The intention of an ideal virtual reality is to be absolutely convincing; and it obviously was. But things looked the same as they always had; these were internal ponderings rather than experiential awakenings.

I was pulled out of this mind trip however, approximately an hour after dosing, due to the now severe case of nausea that had been creeping up since the beginning. The acute sensation brought me into a darker, grouchy emotional state as I stalked through the forest looking for a place to throw up. I had stamped about for about ten minutes wondering what to do when my friends appeared on the look out for me. They were also experiencing nausea and suggested we go smoke some pot to kill the feeling. It sounded like the best idea to me.

We smoked a bowl under the shelter and that is when time, space and my mind joined hands for a final ring-around-the-rosie. My friends walked off to explore while I stared out at black sky, black rain, black sand, pounding black ocean. The digital water music I heard before exploded into a thunderous techno of crashing bass waves and a million glassy raindrop tones. I was cold and wet and decided outdoors in a downpour was the last place I wanted to be. I headed for the small three-man tent, pulled my shoes and jacket off at the entrance and crawled into the bright, cocoon-like interior. 'Ashes, ashes, we all fall down,' and I landed hard. For the next few hours, two fundamental mindsets fought for control of my consciousness. The first mindset was my ego-sense: the opinion that I was a human named Josh with some 20 years worth of memories who had consumed a psychedelic substance and was experiencing a corresponding trip. That part of my mind suffered a terrifying emotional roller coaster in the tent, beating myself up for being so stupid as to ingest a substance I was not, it seemed, the least bit prepared for. The effects at this point were more intense than I could have possibly imagined. I rolled around in my sleeping bag alternating between hysteria and tears. I saw the red-edged tent door flapping in the wind and thought it was the blood-soaked image of a demon tormenting me. The cause of all this suffering was the emergence of another fundamental mindset.

To the frightened Homo sapien in the tent, it was total reality loss. Very simply, I became aware that the universe is a dream, infinitely long, endlessly varied and eternally cycling. This awareness came in the form of anamnesia, that is a re-remembering of what was once forgotten. I 'remembered' the true nature of reality and time with absolute certainty. I remembered the last time I had been on this beach in this tent scared shitless. I remembered it from the previous rotation on the wheel of time. Consciousness and reality merged into what amounted to a pure and continuous d駛a vu. My terrified ego desperately relived memories of my life and recent past as evidence of their existence but all these images were fading invisibly away as dream memories soon do upon awakening. Alone in the tent, solipsism (the belief that only the self creates reality) reined supreme. I stared at the brand names of my shoes and sandals, baffled that I could come up with such realistic names. In a very real sense, I realized *I* was the cosmic programmer who had carefully designed and created a totally convincing experience made of props (trees, animals, buildings), characters (family, friends, lovers), and a plotline (joys, sorrows, etc.) Up to this point, the current episode of the cosmic life-game had been sort of a coming-of-age number maybe transitioning into a love story. I was the writer, the director, the star, the audience. Of course, in order to be really interesting, the last step in the setting in motion of this vast, cosmic drama was the removal of my memory of having created it. (A dream is, obviously, the perfect model for what I am describing.) As I figured it, the mushroom was merely a unique key planted in reality as a mechanism for waking up from the dream. In my current state, I was out of time, in a singularity of sorts, where I could see the universe for what is truly was.

One of my friends returned, soaked to the skin through his entirely waterproof outfit. He joined me in the tent and I puzzled over who this person really was. I didn't know if we were sharing the experience and he had discovered the same ultimate truth that I had, or if he was part of the dream. After acting distant and being rather incommunicative, I finally started a conversation that seemed to perfectly justify the first possibility. It seemed that everything my friend said was confirmation that he had had the same awakening. The same singularity that made my solitary hours seem like an infinitely repeating nightmare, now made our conversation go in loops. The same five minute period of time seemed to loop over and over again as we made identical comments and identical gestures. Again, d駛a vu.

Eventually my other friend returned to the tent after running all over the area. It was about four or five hours after we had dosed and we were all coming down. At some point I had reconnected with consensus reality and was left only with a great relief that I was back. We smoked some more bud and it only relaxed me further. I don't think I discussed the intensity of my trip until some days later. We waited out the downpour and came out to clearing skies that evening. I felt very refreshed and peaceful after such a tumultuous day. We hiked all the way back the next day.

While under the influence of the mushrooms I swore that I would never touch them again. Afterwards, having returned to my previous state, I questioned the experience critically. My main obstacle was in discarding my two misconceptions about mushrooms. In comparing my trip with those of my friends and everyone else I've talked to, my experience was unique and infinitely more intense. At that time, I couldn't reconcile what happened to me with what 'should' have happened. Through experimentation in later trips, I've determined that it is the mixing of marijuana and mushrooms that produces this mind-blowing trip. Due to my abnormal sensitivity to pot, psilocybin actually activates the *marijuana*. Since that first shroom, I've recontacted that singularity from just pot alone. Without any bud, I have the standard shroom trip. Beautiful, inspiring, unambiguously positive. I wonder if I'll ever have the courage to intentionally mix psilocybin and THC to have that intense trip again.

Even though it was a terrifying experience of ego-death, it has been a fundamental force in my life and spiritual thought processes. In the terms of William James, this experience continues to be absolutely authoritative over me. That is, even after returning to ordinary reality, I know that what I experienced was true and is still in effect at this moment. I know I will inevitably find myself back there again on the beach as time plays ring-around-the-rosie into the infinite future.







Tripping outdoors is always the best, letting Mother Nature personally guide you. This is how it went one night last summer.

Summer break was ending and my friends (Bill, Marcus and Jamal) were just getting back into Colorado from other states.  We had all simultaniously gotten into this drug thing but we had never tripped together.  There was nothing to do on campus this Friday night, but I had 8 hits of acid on me.  I ran into my friends outside our dorm and told them my plan.  To make a night of it we drove Bill's Cougar up towards Rocky Mountain National park at about midnight.  About half an hour after dosing we stopped in a small mountain town along the way to walk around and look at things, including a large dinosaur (triceratops) skeleton in a shop window that we could not stop laughing at.  After meeting this creature and realizing we weren't sober any longer we decided to head on up into the mountains.

Bill's car stereo is one of the best I have ever heard.  When it's turned up and the windows rolled down you can hear it from literally miles away, we were fortunate to have it with us that night.  As we were listening to DJ Dan while acending deeper into the forest and farther from the rest of the world we decided to pull over and explore.  The moon was full, and the entire forest was ours, it might as well have been some beautiful new green planet we were on.  We found ourselves in a little valley with a stream in the middle and forrested mountains on two sides, with the sky clear and every star shining.  Marcus and I decided to take a walk down to the stream while Bill and Jamal broke some new glowsticks and danced in the middle of the road.  After several hours (or minutes?  you can never tell on this drug) I was thinking that there couldn't be another human within 20 miles of where we were.  Right as I converted this thought into words, a car drove by, saw the glowsticks, hit the brakes and turned around and stopped.  

Right as we were about to panic (we were in no condition to deal with other people at this point) two guys stumbled out of the car with two cartons of orange juice!  I can't remember thier story but they were tripping also, driving across the state.  They left us a carton of OJ and we smoked them up, and they went on their way. Analyzing the encounter, they seemed to be just a couple of farmer's kids out having fun like we were.  They came from such a different background compared to four little candy ravers, and we never would have met them, least make friends with them if it weren't for the drugs bringing us together.  Not long after they left we decided to continue up further into the mountains.

Several miles down the road we found the spot:  to this day I think of this little area as my spiritual home.  When I die I am sure this is where my spirit will go immediately.  It's simply a small parking lot on the top of a small mountain pass with overlooks on either side.  On the left there is the remainder of a mountain, on the right a small rocky hill that the road winds around.  One can see the lights of Estes Park (50 or so miles away) and possibly further from the overlook, thousands of feet higher than the valleys below.  We were two hours into our trip now, and everything was beautiful, too much so for words to begin to describe.  Huge green pine trees were all around us, concealing us from the world and the world from us.  I had purchased Paul Oakenfold's 'Tranceport' that day and had not listened to it yet.  We put that CD in the stereo and listened as the bass rumbled through the forest, through the valleys so far below and up past the high mountaintops.  I credit that music for creating the feelings felt that night.  We stayed in that spot and danced the night away.  The trees seemed to dance to it also.  At one point the four of us took a walk down the road to look down into the world.  Bill and I were leading with Marcus and Jamal trailing and having a wierd debate about TV commercials or something.  There was a tree laying on its side that apperently gave Bill weird vibe, so he approached it and asked no one in particular 'Are these trees?  I don't think so...'.  On closer inspection they were indeed trees.  All of us had the same perception problems and had a blast sorting things out, but not before engaging in an argument with the downed log.

Back at the car Bill and I decided we needed a campfire.  We had planned ahead and brought lighters, wood and newspaper to light, so we opened the trunk to get the materials.  'Wait, what were we doing again?' 'I forgot...I know we opened the trunk for a reason...hmm'.  Quickly forgetting everything, we danced for who knows how long before Marcus yelled 'Hows that fire comming along?' 'OH YEAH!  A fire!!'.  After forgetting what we were doing several more times the concensus between the four of us was that we were not of mental capacity to start and maintain a fire, and the idea was dropped.  In hindsight, we probably would have burned down the forest so its better that way.

I can't tell you the details of several hours where all memories are kida fuzzy, all I can remember is a feeling.  A feeling of joy, contentness.  More so than MDMA can ever give you.  My three best friends in the world, a different world perhaps, and I were all dumb as animals, trying to get a grasp on reality, but there was no hurry in getting to wherever we were going.  We had all night, and memories of school and the campus were so incredably distant as to be a dream.  It was amazing how much like a dream the past 18 years of my life were.  Reality wasn't reality at all, and I was finally awakened from it, into a far better place where reality is constantly changing at the touch of a thought.

As the sun began to rise we decided to climb the rocky cliff near the car.  The car!  It must have been 200 yards away  and twice as far below us but we could hear Tranceport as clear as ever.  I remember Bill and Marcus climbed up farther than Jamal and I, and watching thier silouhettes dancing against the brightening sky.  Rock climbing was dificult, and here we were conquoring the cliff, and proving it by DANCING on it!  We felt as if we had just climbed Everest and were on top of the world.  And the view from the top...  We were surrounded by miles of wilderness all around us and we could look down on it all and command it.  As supeior beings we watched the sun slowly rise and light the valleys below, feeling a bit like Zeus must have on top of Mount Olympus.  Unfortunately the drugs in our systems were waning, and Jamal and I started the long descent back to the car.  As we got to the bottom a park ranger's car was pulling up (oh no!  We were still too cracked out to string two words togeter in a fashon as to not scare a person not on this drug).  Talking to the ranger was fun as it turned out.  It felt like my mind was so expanded I could understand anything in an instant, while his was compressed and slow.  He was just checking to see if we were OK as it turned out, and gave off a good vibe.  Nonetheless, it was almost 8 am!! and we took it as a sign it was time to head home.  

At the time none of us realized what had trancepired [sic] that night, I hope I conveyed it into words suitably.  It was the perfect trip.  We did everything:  traveled to new worlds, met mother nature personally, talked to her trees and rocks and mountains.  Practiced telepathy.  We met new people experiencing the same things as we were.  We danced.  We discovered new ways of thinking.  We bonded.  No matter what happens many years from now, The four of us will always have that night to look back upon.  Everything was perfectly synchronized.  We got into the mountains righ as we were beggining to peak.  We had just enough lsd in us to see the sunrise and try our hand at being immortal.  When it was time to call it quits and go home God sent that park ranger out to us.  Every time I listen to Tranceport I remember the feelings of this night, although they get fainter and fainter every time.  Still, I look back on it as the best night of my life.  If i were to die tommorow it would be OK because I was there, experiencing it, having more fun than anyone should be allowed to have, and knowing that only a fraction of a percent of all life on Earth has discovered what joy is.  What it feels like to awaken from the dream that was reality.  Thank you Mother Nature and Paul Oakenfold.







This was going to be my second time smoking marijuana.  After asking my parents if i could stay with a friend for the night, I started walking to his house, excited for what was ahead of me. After the Marijuana had been put into the baggie, we jumped in one of the guys' car, went to a dead end street not to far from our houses, and began to put the Marijuana in the pipe. I took my 5 moderate hits, and then we began to drive to Wal-Mart for munchies. In the car i didnt think i was high. but then someone asked me, are you feeling it? do you hear the music? I asked the driver of the car what kind of system he had, he said he didnt have one!!! At that point i realized i was high. 

As we walked in i started thinking about it, and started laughing hysterically. I was laughing at everyone and everything, and when i was walking and doing things, it was like i didnt know what i was doing, but everything was being done automaticly. If you have seen the movie half-baked in the beginning when they are kids and walking into the store and everything is flashing, that is what it felt like. I kept getting very nervous, it felt like all the people were watching us, and i thought we were going to get in trouble. It was weird though, because i could concentrate to stop laughing, and i could do it. As we were leaving Wal-Mart i was trying to remember where the car was, and got lost for a couple of minutes, then remembered what it looked like. I got in the car and the 5 of us were cruising, when we saw two cops checking out a house, we all got so scared, we were like hurry the fuck up! They never even came out of the driveway. 

The paranoid while high theory is true, everytime i saw a car on the road, i thought it was a cop and was ready to open the door and run, i was so damn scared. We were listening to the music, just sitting in the driveway, eating the chips we had bought. it sounded awesome. It sounded like they were playing in the car, we were listening to disturbed. After listening to the music, we wanted to get scared, so we walked in the woods, we got scared, i dont want to tell you what happened, but do it sometime, it is one hell of an experience. After that we went inside the house:

ALL MARIJUANA SMOKERS TRY THIS!!! TURN THE T.V. ON FOR A FEW MINUTES, THEN TURN IT OFF, YOU CAN SEE THE ELECTRICITY STILL ON THE SCREEN, IT KICKS ASS. JUST CONCENTRATE, WE ALL SAW DIFFERENT THINGS. Then after that we tried to go to sleep, but i heard this really weird noise, it sounded like fish were jumping out of a lake and i could hear the water splashing, or another i described it was someone throwing stones into water. It was very neat, but it was kind of freaky. I asked anyone if they heard this, everyone said no except for one person, and he described it the exact same way,and was hearing it at the same time I was, that surprised me, and I wondered why we could hear it and no one else could.
That is about all I remember, Like i said, that was my first time getting high, and it was the best experience of my life so far, truly phenominal. It is a shame for this to be outlawed, if the politicians ever got high im sure they would want to legalize it. If we had one politician supporting it, all the MJ smokers would be backing them up. I am a good student, and no one would ever know what I did.
I'm just the average teenager, you know.









My friend had some experience with X and had told me about it.  One day, she said she had come across some really good stuff (chocolate chips from Amsterdam), and asked if I was interested.  I had done acid once before, and was a seasoned pot smoker.  I was ready for it.  We got the tabs, and prepared ourselves by getting some comfortable clothes, a video (alice in Wonderland), and generally psyching ourselves up for the event.

Upon taking the drug, I was somewhat anxious for the fun to begin.  After watching TV for a while, I noticed K acting funny.  She is significantly smaller than me, so I guess it hit her faster.  I wasn't feeling anything.  Then, I decided to stand up.  WHOAH!  COLD FLOOR ON BARE FEET!  It was like ice.  It was so cold it tickled.  Happy happy happy.  I began to dance around.  I could almost hear music in my head.  I settled down and we proceeded to massage one another with a mentholyptus rub (half a jar in all:  the smell was in my room for 3 days).  Masturbating was never this good.  I was shuddering from the waves of pure, unadulterated delight that were just sweeping over me like a rising tide.  I honestly heard some heavenly choir singing.  

I received a couple of random phone calls from some people I hadn't heard from in a while, some of whom later came over.  Hearing those voices was like a reunion of some long-estranged family or something.  Utter elation.  I could NOT hold anyone close enough to me.  I wanted to keep squeezing until I had totally absorbed them into myself.  The drug is aptly named.  If you are ever looking for that total mind/body massage and spiritual connection with another person, this is the way to go.  We finished the night wrapped tightly in a fuzzy blanket listening to some beautiful violin music.  I was so happy and at peace that I almost wept.







The only drug other than pot that I'd had any experience with at the time was acid.  And I'd done lots of acid, enough to the point that I'd quit about 2-3 months erlier.  I'd done a bunch of online research on MDMA at websites like Erowid and Lycaeum, and had decided that I wanted to try it.  A friend of mine was going to a rave with the intention of rolling, and he usually knows people there, so I gave him money and told him to pick me up a tab.  And he did - a little white pill called a Chronic 2000.  It had a split on one side, and (much to my amusement) a bud leaf stamped on the other side.  That next weekend, I went to a rave (Together as Two) with the same friend, and my roll, and later my friend purchased a new pressed Chronic at the party.  Anyways, we ate our tabs at around 12:45.  It was weird for me, as I get very strong placebo, even when I eat normal pills like Asprin or Tylonal.  With this, however, there was no placebo at all.  About 15 minutes later, I'd noticed that things just seemed kind of different.  No specific effects, yet, but I knew the roll was coming on none the less.  

This being my first roll, I wanted to be sitting down when it hit (just in case).  So, we went and sat down, and I was sitting there.  Still no specific effects.  I'd heard that X makes you really happy and made things feel really really good.  I didn't notice either of these, but I still knew the roll was coming on.  A few minutes later, I noticed that I was rubbing my legs - not that it felt special, just for the sake of rubbing something.  It just became something I wanted to do.

Then, I noticed that my vision seemed to change, just like when you do any drug, like alchohol or pot.  Everything just kinda looked different, and then I felt really, really happy!  There were a lot of people rolling at that party, with all kinds of tabs going around - Chronics, Supermans, Buddha's, Christmas Tree's, Milleniums, etc, etc - and I felt all happy for the other people who were Xing too.  I would just look at any random person, and feel like they're my best friend.  I'd ask them 'Are you rolling?'  I asked a bunch of people that, and to my recollection, only two said no.  I felt really happy for them, and knew I'd found a new drug of choice.  I was sitting with my legs crossed, and stood up slowly, which was an interesting experience in itself, and went to go get some water, on the way asking people if they were rolling.  I learned something that night - When you tell people at a rave that you're on your first roll, they'll do really cool things to you.  I got a hand massage, somebody blew onto my eyes through one of those tubes that you get at Randalls (I forget what they're called), which was nice.  Somebody else let me use a vapor mask while they rolled they're fists up my back - that felt REALLY good!  

So any way, I continued on journy to the bathroom with two plastic cups, and filled them up in the bathroom.  I looked at my eyes in the mirror while I was in there - they were pretty dilated.  Now, for some reason, I'd decided to hold both refilled cups of water in my left hand.  And, as I was walking back to where we were sitting, I lifted a cup to my mouth to drink - forgetting that I was holding two cups - and drank some water.  After I was finished drinking, I looked down at myself, and realized that I'd poured water all down my shirt.  I would rub my soaked shirt on my stomach and chest and shoulders, and that felt really interesting, too.  Later, we went over to where the speakers were.  We leaned up against them.  It was my friends idea, and he enjoyed it - I didn't really get anything out of it, but while there, I noticed a guy who was laying down, with his head inside one of those little square holes on the speaker.  I looked at him, and he looked at me, and we smiled at each other - He looked reaaaaaally happy =)

Eventually we went back to where we'd started, and sat back down.  My roll was starting to wear off now, and I wanted to keep rolling, but I noticed something else.  The come down off X didn't suck like it did when I took acid, which was the only other drug that I really had to compare to X.  When I would take acid, during the come down, my muscles would start to ache, I would be hungry but not want to eat food, and I'd have that acid taste on my tounge.  With X, I simply became sober again, and I thought to myself, 'Wow, I really like X'.  It's now been almost two months since that roll, and I hope to do it again very soon.  I've read alot about tabs that are DXM, and one that was 95\% guaffesin (ugh)...I'll just have to hope I don't get one of those.  Well, just thought I'd share my little experience with all you happy people out there....So, until next time, farewell.







Ecstacy was first brought to my attention by a friend. My immense interest in the chemical world and the idea of 'consciousness expansion' coupled with her descriptions of the experience allowed my normally well behaved reserved self to try the drug (i.e. i'd only smoked weed once prior). Also, The fact that my four closest friends were going to do it didn't hurt either. Still, I was a bit concerned about it because the night before a close friend very knowledgable and experienced with drugs had sternly warned me against taking e and told me it was a stupid drug. 

Painfully curious and wondering if ignorance is bliss, I went ahead and did it anyway. On the Saturday before, three friends of mine had attended a techno dance club (not old enough, I was unable to get in). Two of them, we'll call these girls M and A, took the drug and related the experience as amazingly pleasant. The other boy, S, didn't have the money to purchase the drug but still managed to have a wonderful time dancing, hugging, and feeling the 'vibe' of the other people around him, most of them on ecstacy. Since my guy friend, P, and I were not able to join in the fun at the dance club because of our ages and S still really wanted to try the drug, a few days later we had a small gathering for all of us to do it for the first time at the house of A. Despite the fact that both of A's parents were home, we were in no way deterred from enjoying the experience and had little threat of disruption from them as we kept almost exclusively to her locked room. 

The night in question was a cold December Wednesday night, the first day of our Christmas Vacation. About an inch of snow had covered the ground making driving a slight bit hazardous but a rather mild danger compared to a lot of storms one faces during Midwest winters. Uninformed and unprepared I brought nothing for the evening. Thankfully my friend M and I stopped on the store on the way there and picked up some suckers and for ourselves and our friends to enjoy. 

About 8:15 P.M., M and I made the 20 minute trek to A's house (She lives in a town 20 minutes away from the rest of us but still attends our high school) over the slick snowy roads and arrived safely. There we waited for A's guy friend, G, to bring the pills. I would estimate the lovely white round Buddha in my memory to be about 100 mg. G and two girls with him, J and K, took their pills about 8:45 PM and left to go to see some other friends but would return later.

 Impatiently M, A, and I waited in her room for S and P to arrive as we promised to all take the pills at the same time. About 9:15 PM they finally arrived and we took the pills in her room. Waiting for the e to kick in we sat on her bed and floor watching some tv. Quietly we sat through most of a rerun of 'Married With Children' until A told us she was starting to roll and couldn't watch tv anymore. So we put on some music, turned off the lamp, put on her two strobe lights and it didn't take long before the rest of us were rolling as well. I was probably the last to start feeling it. At first I was quite confused as A had P rub Icy Hot on the back of her neck. I didn't understand their fascination with a small blinking red light in a keychain either. I looked at it a while trying to see what they saw but it didn't capture my attention much so I went and sat on her bed. More content than usual to observe, I watched as S put on a Vicks mask and started dancing. A few minutes later my crush, P, approached me with a handful of Icy Hot and vigorously but soothingly rubbed my hands. Still fairly 'with it' at this point I got my hand free for a second so I could put my rings in a pocket before they completely slipped off. This was the last fully rational conscious thought I can remember having that night. 
  
Since none of us were into techno rave-dancing that much the first time we rolled together we found ourselves content to just sit there touching each other's hands and arms and legs. The only words from this time I can remember are few. I can remember the euphoria of hearing P tell me 'Your skin feels SOOO good!' as he and i 'made hand love' and then soon I felt him touching my face. Unlike my second ecstacy experience, there was a long time where I was completely uninhibited and free of self consciousness. And whatever regret or embarrassment I might feel for anything I did that night is wiped away when I realize how honest with my feelings ecstacy let me be, and how easy it was for me to act on my feelings. That one little touch was all it took and soon I was touching P's face as well. Unable to express my deep romantic feelings for this guy friend of mine, through the benefits of ecstacy I was finally able to gaze deeply into his eyes. And for a long time I think I felt him looking back into mine as well. 

I think the peak of the experience (certainly my most pleasant feelings came then) was when the five of us all laid on her bed in a fully clothed orgy of bliss. All of us agreed that this is what Heaven must feel like and since I don't fully buy into the concept of Heaven I was quite pleased to think that for just $30 (G is able to charge an exorbitant amount of money for the pills due to the fact that so few e dealers exist in this area and we are just a bunch of stupid kids) I can experience Heaven any time I feel like it. I was also quite pleased with the fact that as I knew I was experiencing the peak of my euphoria I was still able to realize that I wasn't meant to feel this good all the time. I would describe it as much like a 'soma holiday' from the Aldous Huxley novel, BRAVE NEW WORLD. Our stay in Heaven eventually came to an end with some loud knocking on the door. A bit panicky as we thought it was A's mom coming in to tell us to turn down the music, we quickly got out of bed and braced ourselves for being caught. Thankfully, it was just G, K, and J returning to join our ecstacy party and we quickly forgot about our the fears we felt from our imagined close call. Still, the damage was done enough in the fact that we never fully returned to that Heavenly dream bliss we found lying together on the bed. The 5 of us also lost part of the closeness that we all shared together on that bed. 

This is when some mysterious bad things started to happen. A bit distraught with P being less affectionate with me than I wanted and ignoring me pretty much as soon as, K and J arrived, I sort of withdrew further into myself. I just laid there not really moving but thinking and observing. I suppose the only way I can explain my state of mind at this point was kind of drunk. I can remember making very dumb hand gestures with my hands to the music while laying on the bed trying to amuse myself acting quite stupidly. Once I heard P comment to A about my dorky hand movements, I became a bit hurt so I quit and decided I was just going to pour out some icy hot and rub it on myself. Unfortuneately in a moment of inspired genius I tried dispensing the icy hot by squeezing it as I held it right over my face! At first I didn't feel the cold glop on my face but as I heard K instructing me to get up quickly and go to the bathroom I was quickly brought back to the reality of my situation.

My mind filled with dread as I wondered if I was going to be blind forever and I repeatedly asked them if I was going to be okay. Luckily my eye had been shut VERY tightly and it didn't take long for the cool water to wipe away the cream. To this day I've still never felt any pain from my icy hot injury, discounting HUGE embarrassment. Washing off my face in the bathroom I also noticed the very disgusting brown dissolved sucker floating around in my mouth. I had been generating so much saliva sucking on that thing that the stick to the sucker had long disappeared and I had been too lazy or too out of it to just throw the gross thing away. For about the next 5 days the roof of my mouth was VERY raw and sore because I had been rubbing the sucker so hard up against it in the midst of my trip. As I looked at myself in the mirror with the disgusting dissolved brown ball in my mouth, my gross looking red left eye, and my irritated scarlet flushed cheeks I sobered up considerably.  

After just 2 or 3 minutes in the bathroom I calmed down and returned to the bedroom to just quietly lay down on the bed, forget about my stupid behavior, and enjoy the party. Minutes, maybe hours passed and I laid there just enjoying the scenes and the people talking around me while I kept silent in my own uninterrupted universe until I noticed P squatted close to the floor with his eyes closed not moving. I brought this to the attention of K and M and we quickly moved him to the bathroom. There all of us (aside from A who just watched the scene from the bed) took turns slapping his face and praying he'd regain consciousness. I remember standing helpless and terrified as K lifted up his eyelids to display lifeless white marbles and pulled the sucker from his mouth so he could not choke and hopefully speak. The whole scene was eerily similar to the episode of Real World Hawaii where Ruthie has alcohol poisoning and has to go the hospital. 

Finally we removed P's shirt and G put a cold wet towel on his back and dumped water on his face bringing him slowly back to life. Within ten minutes P was totally revived and ready to have fun again. The frightening part of this whole thing is that none of us know what caused P to freak out so bad. G, a very experienced ecstacy user and raver, later remarked he had NEVER seen anyone have a reaction like that to e and just thought that P had epilepsy and the seizure was caused by the strobe lights in A's room. Perhaps even scarier is the fact that P has no recollection of the entire thing, it's a total blackout, and an hour after the whole thing he was asking G if he could buy another pill. We still don't know what caused P's blackout, if it was a medical condition or just a bad pill. Another scary moment was when S and A were on the bed waving their cigarettes like glow sticks and accidentally burned each other, and had to be told by M that their skin was bubbling. 

About midnight G, K, and J left again to take J home. They returned to A's house about an hour later, with a terrifying account of almost flipping G's car over on the icy dark country road, with the car up on two wheels at one point. Slowly, the drug began fading away, getting fainter and fainter each time I gazed at the clock. About 4:00 AM, K and G went home for the night. The rest of stayed at A's house until the morning. While all of us found our bodies rather tired our minds were still wide awake and it was impossible to sleep. For those last few hours P, A, and I rested on P's bed with S close by in a chair. We hugged and touched but tried not to talk too much as that interfered with our thinking. M laid by herself on the floor and that was very pleasing to those of us up by the bed. We just didn't really care for the effect that e has on our friend M, causing her to talk endlessly and redundantly about herself repeating banal uninteresting stories we had heard at least five times already. For example, M informed us all for the eighth time at least that she was such an amazing child that it only took her two weeks to potty train for fear that she would ruin her strawberry shortcake underwear. Several times I wondered aloud 'Why did she just say that, OUT LOUD?' and my friends, as annoyed as I, often yelled at her to be quiet. 

 About 5:30 AM S and P left A's house to get to the kid's house they told their parents they'd be staying at before sunrise. After about 15 minutes of hugging and saying heartfelt goodbyes they left me, A, and M to finally retire for the night. Only able to sleep about 3 and a half hours with my arm pressed firmly over my face to keep my eyes shut, I woke up amazingly rested. This alert feeling didn't last much longer than the car ride home but sleep still didn't come very easy at home on the couch. I laid there watching television, as it was the only way I could get my mind off thinking about the crazy night before, and about 12 retired to my bedroom to sleep about six hours until my angry mother woke me for dinner. A bit tired for the next few days I was eventually able to catch up on sleep. When I decide to do ecstacy again, if I decide to do ecstacy again, I plan to take a very long nap before I go out for the evening.  

 Despite the overall pleasantness I am not able to totally forget the night's darker moments. Looking back I have to grimace at the thought of actually for a second touching my crush's armpit and in the midst of caressing his face wiping snot from his nose but at the time nothing felt more right, and any digusting impropriety became exceedly hilarious. 

There were a few unexpected other sensory treats that ecstacy provided me with as well. Being a rather introverted shy person yet very interested in the behavior of others, I enjoy observing and found ecstacy to be very beneficial and compatible with this activity. After the drug was wearing off a little my friend A asked me if I was enjoying the experience and commented how I was very quiet and just kept saying 'Whoa!' as I laid there in the bed comfortable not to move. Not curled up in a fetal position but it was more like my body was sleeping but my mind was awake. I don't recall any sort of intense colors or hallucinations one might associate with LSD or shrooms but watching my friend S dance was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. His shaggy brown hair was loosely wound into about 20 dreadlocks and flew wildly as he moved to the rhythm. Seemingly in time with the beat, the strobe light provided an interesting still frame effect. It seemed like the whole time I was watching my friend dance in slow motion, as if I was watching an old black and white movie one frame at a time. His shadow was also rather breathtaking with the pointy strands waving and bouncing away from his silhouette, also seemingly synchronized with the music. A second unexpected treat came when we knocked over a glass of water onto the floor. My senses were so amazed and pleased by the chilling pool of water amidst the the furry soft carpet that I suggested spilling more water on A's carpet. Thankfully the others involved expressed a bit more restraint than I and convinced me against ruining her floor.

 Finally, there was one last thing that troubled me about my first experience with ecstacy. The guy who got us the pills, G, told my friend A that ecstacy was addictive. He also told her that there was heroin in the pills. I have to wonder about things that G says, however, because he also swears he is addicted to acid when most people agree that LSD is NOT addictive. And, my other very experienced drug using friend who even though he told me not to use ecstacy, told me it was NOT addictive and pointed out that even if there really was heroin in the pill, the amount of heroin would not be enough to do anything. I suppose this confusion and basic lack of information just proves to me why the War Against Drugs is such an awful thing. Because what those just say no campaigns and D.A.R.E. t-shirts are fighting against are not the drugs themselves, but information about drugs. Real, honest information that sites like erowid.org provide. Thanks whoever might read this. Stay healthy and have fun! 

So to take inventory of the evening...
The Good-
  - the orgy bliss
  - the most pleasant feeling of my life
  - closeness with friends
  - the sensory treats
  - satisfied curiosity
  - lost inhibitions

The Bad
  - i made an ass out of myself
  - i saw a friend lose consciousness
  - the guy who got us pills told us they had heroin in them
  - two of my friends believe they're addicted 
  - i accidentally stepped in K's puke
  - S and A got cigarette burn scars on their hands
  - sick feeling and unable to sleep the next day  
  - $30

Is it worth it?
YOU DECIDE.







I had done Salvia a few times before, and after having only pleasant (or at least, interesting) experiences I wanted to try to really 'break through' and take a large bowl of the 5x extract.  It was very large; I couldn't finish it all in one toke, so I exhaled and took another.  I  don't remember putting the pipe down, but I was outside in my backyard with friends nearby, so I felt safe.

I thought to myself, 'I will wait for it to kick in.  It shouldn't take long, I just need to wait.  Waiting...'  Then the voice of Salvia (coming through my own psyche) spoke, mocking me.  She said 'What are you waiting for? A bus?'

'A bus?!'  What is she talking about?  Then I saw something: a colorful pattern of colors, culring like a fractal pattern, and I instantly knew what I was seeing:  my own thoughts.  I was looking at the thought, 'A bus?!' (which of course I was still baffled about.)

As I pondered the notion of the bus-stop further, my changing thoughts changed the pattern that I was seeing, although on more minute levels than at first.  

I felt a deep sense of revelation:  I can't explain it now, but it had something to do with the nature of thoughts, salvia, the colors I was seeing, and this bus-stop at which we all wait.  This struck me as being very odd, especially the part about the bus-stop.  Then, like a ton of bricks, I realized the utter insanity of it all.  I was totally insane!  I suddenly remembered where I was, in my backyard, and felt good that I had friends nearby.

There is a story of a zen monk who aspires unity with the Godhead by clearing his mind through meditation at the time of his death.  Then along came tiniest fleeting memory of a beautiful deer he admired as a child.  He was reborn a deer.

I think that salvia is like this.  A tiny disjoint thought can spawn the basis of an entire trip, and whether it makes any 'sense' or not is irrelevant.  Therefore, choose your set and setting with great care, and always a friend at hand.







[Erowid Note: 
Most Coricidin contains CPM (Chlorpheniramine Maleate) which can be dangerous in high doses. See DXM Brand Warnings for more info.]

My friend 'Bill' and I were going to do dxm together for the first time.  He was experienced, but more with the robitussin side of the field.  We would be trying Coricidin cough tablets, 30mg per pill.  We bought three boxes and split them up evenly.  Using gatorade to wash them down, the plan was to take them one at a time every minute until we were done, starting at 7 pm.

We would be watching 'What dreams may come' for the stunningly vivid colors and grand theme until we started to feel some heavier effects and then switch on the cd player and listen to some music a friend reccommended for the night.

We started taking the pills.  Bill had a much harder time of it than I did, for some reason.  He says he just hates taking pills.  After about 6, I decided to just take the rest all together.  After about 3 more, Bill did the same.  He says he now feels it's better to get it over with all at once.

Awaiting the experiences start didn't take too long.  At about 8pm we both started seeing trails and feeling the 'monkey on your chest' phenomenon, which he told me to expect and to not panic when it happened.  It was not serious and would pass.  It soon did and I felt a little nauseated.

He went upstairs to puke and I went to the kitchen sink.  After a bit he came back downstairs and stood with me a while.  We were too unstable to walk back to the living room for a little while, but we finally made it, walking, as we say, like lizards.  That is, you sort of furtively sneak around, moving a few steps, regaining your equalibrium, looking around to orient yourself to the surroundings, them move a few more steps, repeating the process until you get to where you want to go. (Or think you do!)

We sat down, each on our own love seat(arranged in an L- shape) and started telling each other about what we were seeing.  I don't remember much what he saw, but I saw little cut-outs of Jimi Hendrix in an army uniform speeding around my line of vision.  In fact, they are all I saw, for a while.

After a bit, I realized we were both lying down on our couches and something wasn't right.  The cd was skipping!  I told Bill and he didn't seem to realize what I was talking about.  Then suddenly he sprang into action to fix the problem, first trying the remote, then moving up to the player directly.  It seemed to take him about an hour to find out how to skip to the next song, but when he looked at the clock on the vcr it was only 10:30pm!  Woah, talk about time dilation!  We were both freaked out that so much had happened in so little time.

As he sat down we both started off on our own little journeys again.  I was a house in New Orleans talking to Jimi Hendrix.  There was a red light on in the background.  When I would open my eyes I was back in Bill's living room.  Weird!  I would close my eyes I would return to talking to Jimi, or go somewhere else.  (Needless to say, at this time, Jimi's cd was playing.)

Sooner or later I found myself in the kitchen at Bill's house.  I didn't know what I was doing, so I decided to go ask Bill.  Maybe I'd told him.  I started walking back to the living room and realized my eyes were closed, but I could still see the furniture and room!  I opened them and the room still looked a bit different, but it was mostly the same.  I closed them and kept walking, as this seemed to make more sense.

I got to my couch and lay down, soon lost in another world again.  Suddenly I was lost.  I had to find Bill!  I opened my eyes and saw that I was grasping his arm in mine, as in an old style arm clasp, where we were each grabbing each other's forearm.  He had a shocked look on his face and his mouth was forming a little o-shape.  

Later he told me that I said I needed an anchor to reality.  We held each other's arm for most of the rest of the night and came to call it the life line, as at one point we both had the same vision that our life forces were intermingling along this link.  One of us would press on the other's forearm with our index finger extended.  In an echo I would hear Bill ask me, 'Did I do that, or did you?'  I had to honestly tell him that I didn't know.  Our own thoughts seemed to cross this life line as well, and occasionally we would lose our own identities and become one.  Kind of freaky, in retrospect, but at the time, not unpleasant at all.

At some time in the night we fell asleep and awoke the next day feeling relaxed and lazy.  Still a bit shaky, we went to Denny's about 8 am and chilled out for a while, just feeling weird being around 'normal' people.  

We'll never forget that first time we did dxm together, but now we regularly try to set appointed weekends, at least one per month, to check out of reality for a while and experiment with seeing another point of view.







I unfortunately happen to be one that really enjoys the Dramamine experience and so I have done it more times than I have done acid and shrooms combined.  It is probably the most dangerous drug I have done and I did it (at a young age) caused both my body and my mind harm in doing so.  There is nothing out there right now that would come close to a good Dramamine trip and as much as I would love to trip 'a good one' at least one more time, I honestly don't think my body could handle it.  Anyway, I would like to indulge you on the first trip I ever had that was on 8 pills of the older Dramamine...

I was barely 14, a freshman in High School, and I wanted to do every drug I could get my hands on.  I had already done a lot of them.  Two of my friends had heard of tripping on Dramamine, and at first I didn't think that was much of an interesting concept, but I wanted to give it a shot.  So we each took eight pills.

It took a while to kick-in, but after about 15 minutes I began seeing flat items as three demencianal.  Then things became unreal, I was sitting at the kitchen table and looking at the wood patterns on the table. I could see the shapes forming faces that would move and I felt they were trying to scare me and cause me to have a bad trip so I told them not to try and scare me because I wanted to have a good time, and at that time that seemed normal.  There was writing on the table that wasen't really there and I was trying to read it out loud, but as I would follow the sentances with my eyes the parts I had just read would change, so I gave-up.  Some how, I made it to a chair in the living room.  In all the Dramamine trips I have been through it has always been the case that I would find somewhere to sit or lay and would not be able or even think of moving my body.  In most cases my mouth would often hang open while I mouthed words that I would not speak. 

Anyways, in this chair I started passing out and then waking up and passing out again, yet I couldn't tell the difference.  My eyes would close yet I could see through them and so I wouldn't notice they were closed until they opened.  I sat in the chair with massive hallucinations, there was a non-existant party going on where I was having conversations with people who weren't there and I was mouthing words that weren't coming out. I could hear them in my head and the false person I was talking to could hear them too, but later my friends told me that I was just staring and mouthing.  The TV in front of me was actually turned off, but in my little world there was a remote in my hand and I was watching the TV and changing the channels, when a porn came on the imaginary station I couldn't change it back and kept talking to my friends about how disgusting it was yet my friends were already passed out on the couch (another thing that happens, you always knock right out in the end).  I would pass-out and be in my friend's mother's van driving down the road and talking to friends in the van, and then my eyes would open.  The whole time, I didn't once think, 'God, I'm fucked-up!'  because you don't think when you are tripping on it, you just are, and everything just is.  You don't think about your friends or yourself or that you may get in trouble, you just are.  After about 2 hours of intense tripping (at least thats the best estimate of time I can come-up with) I passed-out into a dead rest, and while I was sleeping I was still tripping.

There were many other times that I tripped on the drug and a lot of the times it was unpleasent.  If you trip good, everything is fine and you wouldn't notice if it wasn't, but if you don't trip than it is hell.  My heart almost exploded once, and it scared the shit out of me, I had been using Dramamine too often and it was ruining my heart.  I now have heart problems (palpitations, I come close to fainting, rapid heart beats, etc.)and stomache problems, and I haven't been quite right since my period of Dramamine facination.  I think that everyone should try this drug at least once because there's nothing like it (you probably don't know what it's like to be totaly fucked out of your mind until you've tried it), but I also don't think so, because the experiance is risky and can do a lot of damage.  Yet there is nothing else like it, and believe me I love my drugs, but this one scares me and it is too risky.  It is more than an acid trip, shrooms or ether, but besides the pysical risks, the TOTAL and utter detachment to reality is dangerous.  Be prepared.






My family owns a cottage in the muskoka lakes area; it is a modest house on an absolutely breathtaking lake surrounded by coniferous woods. My family usually goes up there around august, but this summer i decided to venture earlier and meet some friends at their cottage just across the lake. I brought up the essentials for my partying: liquor, pot and fungus (about 10 grams in case anyone else wanted them). But to my surprise, my friends were not at their cottage and i was forced to spend 2 nights alone. The first night i rented a movie and had a couple drinks with it, followed by some good, old-fashioned sleeping in. 

The next evening was an experience i'll never forget. The day started off simple enough, with a hot cup of coffee and a cigarette. I then went to see if my friends were home yet, and with luck, i had caught them as they were packing up to go back to the city for another week. However they purchased most of my mushrooms from me, leaving me with about 4 grams for myself. I decided that night was when they would be consumed. Besides, i hadn't had a spiritual experience for a while, so why not?

    I went to town and rented another movie, and at about 7 o clock i began watching. As the previews rolled by, i noticed the lack of anything else to eat with my shrooms. All i had left was pop. So i took a piece of paper, folded it in half the long way, and poured the dust in the fold. I funneled all the dust into my mouth as i tipped my head back and took a swig of my coke. The combo fizzed unexpectedly, overflowing in my mouth and spilling approx. a gram of fungi. I reluctantly swallowed the remaining mix, and grimaced from the bittersweet taste. I continued watching my movie and didn't notice any differences until the ending, when forrest gump's face began to ebb and flow in tiny ripples. I looked around the living room, at the setting sun, and felt a visual equivalent of sexual arousal, i wanted to intensely observe my surroundings all i could.

It went like that for about 2 hours, me sitting in the living room, taking in my surroundings and sensing so many things at once that i felt i had to get out; although i was the only one in the house, i felt i had to get out. My sudden claustrophobia caused me to jump out of my recliner and to the screen door, i rushed out the door as if not getting away from something anymore, but magnetized toward something. I felt myself walk along the lakeside not exactly sure of where i was going, but positive that i was going somewhere. My instinct told me just to keep walking.

It felt like about a half hour that i trod the shoreline, my eyes fixed on the water still as glass. I contemplated whether or not it would be possible for me to walk on the glassy surface, or to iceskate in the middle of summer. 

My eyes strayed straight ahead as i realized i was at a resort on the same lake as my cottage. My purpose became dreadfully clear: i was to find myself near here. I kept tracing the shoreline until i came to the clearing that was the golf course. It was truly a magnificent sight to behold; i saw a perfectly trimmed grass clearing, with the crystal clear lake to one side, with the moon reflecting softly off the water. On the other side of the clearing was the dark, menacing woods,casting shadows and concealing evil, no doubt. I felt frightened by the woods, but reassured myself by refixing my eyes on the water. 

And so i walked on, coming to the center of the golf course and noticing in the moonlight a white object placed in the middle of the course. I walked closer until i could make it out, then stopped in bewilderment. It was a muskoka chair (adirondack chair for you yankees) placed, oddly enough, in the middle of the goddamn golf course. What purpose would it serve? I suddenly realized it was there for me. I was to find myself in this chair. 

Slowly i lowered myself into the chair, it was covered in dew and faced toward the lake. I took this as a metaphor for how i should live. I should begin looking at the good(lake) and stop my pessimism by turning my back to the bad(woods).

As i looked out into the water, i began thinking about myself and how i had been living my life lately. My career had come secondary to socializing and i had neglected my family for the past year. I could see myself in the lake as if it had turned from glass into a mirror, showing me what i was doing in my life and how to change it. I came to the divine realization that only hard work and optimism could make me into the kind of person i wanted to be. I sat in the chair until sunrise, when i promptly marched back home and got some much-needed sleep. I had beats pounding through my head at 4 a.m. and they had since died away. 

My life has drastically been changed by this experience and i haven't done mushrooms since. My hard work and optimism have paid off in a recent relationship and a promotion at my job. I feel refreshed every day i wake up and i have those 3 grams of mushrooms to thank for it. They opened my eyes to what's really going on in my life.







What I had really wanted to get was ecstasy but all my friends were dry that night. and you know how it is when you get it in your head to be fucked up. you have to get something. so a friend was selling eightballs (3.5 grams of coke)and I went ahead and made the purchase. My best friend had done coke before - is still fighting the addiction - and so I knew that if I was going to do this I would at least have someone experienced around me. 

I was so nervous before I did that first line. My stomach was all in knots. In retrospect, I did a monster line. Almost immediately my pulse sped up and I felt a little edgy. After a few minutes I calmed down and did another monster line. I began to feel almost as though I was on X, only I had much more energy and couldn't stop moving around. My friend chooses to use coke with needles, and though at first i refused to even watch him, I was so out of my head after maybe an hour that when he offered to give me a hit intravenously, I didn't have any problem with it even though I hate needles. I'm not sure where my self-defense mechanisms went, but all I cared about was how to get a better rush. I wanted to know what my friend was feeling. I was talking a mile a minute, feeling very open. In that respect it was similar to ecstasy, but without the physical sensetivity. The intravenous rush was more like smoking rock than snorting the powder. Almost immediately I felt something pushing me back, making me relax, making me feel good. I had to close my eyes. I did that twice (though I'd said only once and never again), and I hope I never do it again. I don't like the idea of having no real self control. I did so much coke that night that I physically could not stop moving around. We started using at around 11:30 PM and the next time I looked at the clock it was 4:30 in the morning. I couldn't believe that so much time had passed. 

By 6:00 the entire eightball was gone. I don't know who had the majority of it, but my friend was coming down hard while I was still wriggling around in my underwear and a tank top (at some point during the night I had decided that the pants needed to come off).

I left his house with a bad feeling. Using cocaine can be a social thing, but not if an addict is involved. It wasn't as though we were hanging out together and doing this. He was using and I was using and we were in our own separate worlds. I don't feel good about that. I feel drugs should be used to enhance, not to separate. 

So from that first experience I learned that 'everything in moderation' should be applied to cocaine as well. ODing on coke, a line that I believe I was teetering on, is no fun. Coke can be fun, but not if you use it for the wrong reasons (eg: because you need more, because you're depressed, etc). Be smart, listen to your body, and be careful.

Before discovering absinthe, I've had few experiences regarding alcohol. I've drunk many kinds of shots and even got more alcoholized that what might be considered 'proper', but that was all.

I've went with my friends to a discotheque in the early afternoon (kinda of a matinee). I've been wanting to try the famous 'green fairy' for some time. I ordered my absinthe simple, with one ice cube; I almost knew what I was in for when I smelled the drink... it smelled almost like pure ethanol! The liquid was a beautifull yellowish green...

The taste was bitter, strong and rather oily. The imediate warmth one gets from tasting a strong drink, soon spreaded to every fiber of my being and for a few moments I felt like I had something wonderfull, something magical inside me... my every muscle relaxed and I felt great... just imagine when you're in a warm bed and it's cold outside, and it feels so warm and comfy that you don't wanna get out... that is the feeling one gets by drinking the first absinthe glass...

Sadly, that feeling doesn't last much, and you only get it from the first glass of the day (or night, ;)). Afterwards, I felt much more 'connected' to the music and to the 'ambiance' and my sense of touch was a bit erratic, sometimes it felt like I was on painkillers, sometimes it felt like it had been slowed down somehow. There were no other particular distortions of the senses.

Suffice to say, I got very drunk that day, because I drunk another 'pure' absinthe glass and half of another (a friend of mine, said it was too powerfull and he couldn't handle it), but I didn't get much of a hangover afterwards (light headache, some drowsiness...).

Nowadays, I try to enjoy my absinthe without getting too drunk. Sometimes I drink it diluted (tastes great with apple juice). I don't know how much of it's effects can be attributed to alcohol rather than the Artemesia Absinthium, but my experience tells me that it... enhances alcohol somehow, it betters it! It doesn't kill your energy like plain vodka or whatever... it gives a lot more energy!!!!! And it doesn't foul up your gut like whisky, nor give you a hell of a hangover comparatively to other strong drinks.

Beware, though, the quality of the absinthe is *very* important, some of the stuff that is selled as absinthe, is just some foul homemade stuff with wormwood extract oil and vodka. Once I drank one shot, just one shot, of an 'absinthe' that was so foul, so badly tasting; it wasn't even strong, it was rather weak when compared to say...goldstrike! The only 'effect' it gave me was sudden urge to vomit!

My experience last night on LSD was amazing.  My second time tripping, the first of which I had taken a red gel-tab which I had later felt expanded so much of my mind, and was very visual-oriented.  Last night...I felt GOD.  I was GOD.  See, in my 'clique' of friends there has been a lot of turmoil. So two of my closest friends and I decided to have a free night of fun.  We took the acid aware of the possibility that it could be fake, because one girl we were with during the purchase freaked out about it being a 'cheap hit'.  For the first hour, and almost the second, we were in extreme disappointment.  I've been taking Philosophy and doing well in it, and well...wanted to experience the insanity from last time, in my newly philosophical mind.  

Anyway, we end up driving on the New Jersey parkway (for no reason and with a designated driver) going 65 mph, in a rain storm.  My one friend and I ended up with our heads and naked upper torsos out the windows...experiencing first hand what we had stayed indoors and missed last time--NATURE!!  It was INCREDIBLE!   The air pressure was like a vacuum out there, the lights, the water, the speed, the power!!!!  I held my hand out in front of me, i felt rain going down my throat (my mouth was uncontrollably open) the rain hit my skin! OH MY GOD I TINGLED; I orgasmed mini-orgasms all through my body!  

The universe then, 'versed' beyond the back of my hand, and it flowed naturally, chaotically through my fingers and then--it shrunk.  I held all that existed in the palm of my hand...and I SCREAMED!!  The universe roared!!  The fact that I was holding all that existed and knew I was in the presence of God, showing me his power...the fact that the bottom half of my body was in the car did not even exist.  I was free.  I was flying.  I felt the universe in my hand, and I can't explain through words what I felt.  The power.  I was screaming out in this storm, out in this 65mph+ wind, in pure ecstasy.  My mind and body were in bliss.  I felt God's power!  In my hand!!(still outstretched from my soaking wet face as I'm screaming to the top of my lungs to my other 4 friends in the car what absolute, what orgasmic, POWER I was experiencing.)  

I heard my friend from the other side of the car in the front seat (I was in the back) screaming my name, and I knew she was experiencing what I was experiencing! Can't explain...a new reality, raw where I exist in ecstasy!  (effects similar to those of the drug, EXTASY). Normally due to the extreme wind, I think my hand would have buckled, and my lungs unable to take in the air, forcing me back in the car, but Now I was getting off on it!  I was defying it!  I was smacked right in the face by God himself!  I went into this trip, as a strongly positioned ATHIEST, and came out a touched man.  Touched by God himself.  Maybe you think it's the lsd?  But I felt Him.  I can't even begin to describe...It feels like millions of lifetimes have passed by in just these few short hours!!!  I feel as though I have experienced EVERYTHING!! And how foolish I was to be existing with all that exists and not KNOW in my heart that He exists too. God, OH GOD.









I'm a lucky person (aren't we all at times). When I was about 17 I was island hopping in the Carribean and a Puerto Rican guy told me that a tea made from the belladonna plant flower would knock my socks of, but advised me not to try it because it could possibly blind you. Hopeless druggy that I was, I immediately picked some of the flowers (about 3 if I remember) and took them home to make a tea with hot water.

I steeped it for a while and drank about 1/2 of the cup as the evening was setting. I had a little apartment on St. Thomas and settled back to enjoy my trip. Let me reiterate: this was a suicide mission. I was a stupid kid immune to risk and was certainly lucky to survive this rash experiment. Do not try the method I am describing unless you have no respect whatsoever for the value of your physiological existence.

As the sun set I became sleepy and lay down on the mat I called a bed. The next thing I know there was a huge party being held in my bedroom. The people were quite nice. It was a real as real gets. Soon everyone left except for an old peasant man in worn work clothes. We chatted for a while. I must have started to come back to my senses, for when I reached over to touch him to see if he was real, I realized I was touching some of my dirty laundry piled on the floor. It was morning by then. This was the most intense trip I had ever had, but all in all, quite pleasant.

It took me about a day to recover. I was shaky. It was a memorable trip, but again, only because fortune had the benevolence to shine on my unmitigated stupidity for trying such an undisciplined stunt.







I was interested in trying AMT because I really like visuals but I'm not always in the mood for a super intense mind bender like on Acid or Mushrooms. I have had some bad experiences with Mushrooms where all I wanted was for the trip to be over. I knew that if I didn't like the AMT then I would have a VERY long haul ahead of me. So I approached cautiously like all wise people should. I spent the better part of the day preparing mentally (It had been almost 3 mo. since my last (bad) trip). 

Finally, at 7:30 pm my friend came over with my dose.  I didn't want all 50 mg that he had prepared for me so I took a little more than half and gave him the rest. We then headed over to another friends house for a house warming party. The come up took about 2 hours. I think I just barely took the threshold dose for visuals. I began wishing I had taken more. I told myself to enjoy this trip for what it is and try a larger dose later.  

Visually, AMT was very pleasant at this dose; there were streamers and auras around lights. They were very beautiful to look at. Closed eyes produced very slight fractal patterns and realistic looking mental images that seemed to correspond to whatever thought happened into my mind at the time. I could play with these images at will by just thinking about them. Alien spaceships in the form of pyramids were just one of the things I saw in very real movie like way.

Mentally, I was in a state very similar to MDMA. I felt very empathic. Talking with people was not only easy it was fun.  I liked everyone... even people I would not normally speak to I found myself talking to. I could have and, in fact, would have enjoyed talking to my parents (Who I get along with quite well). This particular night marked 69 days to graduation so there was a lot of partying and drinking all around campus. I found interaction with people in all various states of sobriety to be easy and quite entertaining. I can see why they say this drug could be used in a rave situation.

There were also effects that I noticed to be unique to AMT. Body heat regulation seemed to be quite affected. Sometimes I was very cold. Other times I would be burning up. There was a slight rolling effect but different than I have experienced before. Instead of moving in and out of reality, I would move between two different states of conscienceness. One was a very dreamy, soft, comfortable place sort of like a marijuana high but without any confusion or mental cloudiness. The second was a very speedy, excited state where I wanted to run around and play like a little kid. My leg would shake uncontrollably and
I would chew my gum incessantly. (Gum, is a very important thing to have with you on an AMT trip. Otherwise you will probably spend 12+ hours clenching your teeth.) Both states were full of visuals. I'd say only 15\% of the time was spent
in the dreamy state at this dose. It's my hope that a higher dose would have more of that state and less of the speedy state.

The last thing I want to report on is the interaction with marijuana. At 4:30 am (T+9 hours) I smoked an amount of pot that would normally make me moderately high. The effects were amazing. Some people had reported no  synergy with marijuana and AMT. I found this to be quite untrue for myself. My trip became very, very cool at this point. Immediately after taking a hit I would get amazing closed eye visuals. These were the first closed eye visuals to have any color for me. (Normally, I just get black and white checkerboards, etc.) I saw little points of light everywhere but each point had all the colors of the rainbow. The open eye stuff also got more interesting. I could make out faces all over the ceiling and saw patterns in ceiling texture. The ceiling started to crawl and undulate as I am accustomed to on shrooms. It would be quite enjoyable if you like pot and are ready to take things up a notch in intensity. My friend has also noted that Nitrous is VERY cool on AMT. I will definitely pick some up for my next trip.

In summary, AMT was very fun. Take it with somebody (or preferably a group of people) so you don't get lonely after all the night's planned activities end and you are still going. The only possible downsides to AMT that I can see at this low dose are the incredibly long duration (which I found to be a plus -- I didn't hit anything close to baseline until T+21 hours) and the extreme body load. You will be very tired and worn out for the next day or two but still quite functional. Also, there were definite times where a bit of nausea would rear its head. But it would soon subside. Altogether, a good experience and very cheap ($5 for a nice trip if you buy a gram at a time!). Try it if you are so inclined.







I had procured an amount of AMT from Sigma-Aldrich recently, and had taken just enough on one particular night (15-25 mgs) to know that I liked it, and that I would want to try it again in a higher dose.  I was just waiting for the right time.  I had taken a measured 500mg amount of AMT and broke it into 12 (as best I could) same sized piles, which I put into mostly-full OO gelcaps of Vitamin C for ingestion.

HISTORY:  A friend of mine who I'd hung out with extensively in an after-work (we were both workhorses at a pizza place) drinking fashion gave me a call, around 9:30pm.  He was looking for some E, something which I'd been able to provide for him on several occasions, but we had never had the oppurtunity to take them at the same time, lo though we had tried.  Something had always come up and ruined our fun, but not this time.  John is a few years older than me, although I am considerably more experienced etheogenically, and had done shrooms once a fair time ago and liked it, and had done ecstacy numerous times in rave-like environments and at home.  He had never done acid, and did not know what it was like.  

I go to his place, where he is hanging out with 2 roommates smoking pot, and tell him that I can't get E, but I have something better.  There is a bane, however, and that is that I only have 2 doses, and if we trip we're tripping alone.  He is completely unaware of the situation, and quite stoned, and I must have been less than clear in my explanation as to what it was and why he wouldn't be able to split it between himself and one of his roommates (the AMT was the same color as the Vitamin C, so it couldn't be split up), because they told me later that they thought I was saying that I'd mixed it up myself!  I got a bit of a laugh about that, but it caused him some initial apprehension I was unaware of.  

By 11:00 we still have not yet dropped (trying to get E from someone else), when I remember that it is Saturday and we can go see a Laser Light Show (Prof. done) of The Wall.  I decide right then I'm dropping whether he does or not, although he has never seen a LLS, I convice him it's a 'must-do' and he quickly follows suit.  Over the next hour a slowly watch the perma-grin develop on this fellow's face.

AMT to me, can best be described with the following analogy.  If acid is a chevy nova:  fast, loud engine, somewhat noisy when it get's going, engine fumes, and very much an 'in your face' car, then AMT is a BMW Z3.  Does all the same things;  moves you from A to B, can go fast, burns gasoline to create propulsion;  but there is definetly a line between the two:  the Z3 is just plain 'nicer', and that's what you pay the extra money for.  Same thing here.  With LSD you get mad visuals, trails, highly suggestible state accompanied by an acute awareness of the 'vibes' of others.  AMT gives you all of those things.  However, there is none of that unending 'mind-fuck' that accompanies the usual acid-trip.  For example, something that always accompanies my trips is an awareness of seeing faces where I know none exist---lava lamps, rugs, wallpaper, etc.  Lets say I see a big panther head in the rug.  On acid, I might do the following 'oh look theres a panther head panther's remind me of the jungle jungle like the one I saw at 6 flags 6 flags like that time I went there for physics class class like school when I used to see my friend jeff hey i remember a different jeff I used to work with at that camp camping is cool speaking of cool .........'  in my head, in the matter of about 5 seconds.  That is what acid does---it makes your mind 'trip'.  Or, I might see the vision of a floating head, and it's mouth looks like it's moving, and I'll try to make out what it's saying, and alluva sudden I'd realize that what I'm thinking it's saying will make it say that.  You can 'play' with the visuals, in many forms, and influence them.  That is how Acid is 'loud', because all of those thoughts running through your head make you lose track easily, etc.  We call it Mind-Fuck.

AMT, on the other hand, I might see that exact floating panther head.  However, this time I'm just thinking, 'hey, look at that floating panther head, that's cool.  How often can I see something as cool as a panther head in something as boring as the rug.  That's cool (next topic/visual).'  And that makes it worthwhile.  There are still much a suggestible state, and it lasts a long time (at 3:40 p.m. my friend leaves me a message on my voice mail 'dude! It's been almost 15 hours! I'm still goin! WOW!--anyway thanks for the.....').  The good part about it is, I've found I can sleep on it.  Because it doesn't make your mind fly at a million miles an hour, you can calmly 'sink' into the trip and find that it's the next day.  Woke up feeling great, and still a little loopy far into the following evening, probably because I was smoking pot much of the time (I don't much, anymore, only when tripping).  

All in all, I enjoyed the experience VERY much, and feel that the car analogy describes the dichotomy of the experience between AMT and LSD as good as any, and that it is worth that extra 20,000 to get the beamer.  If you can find it, try it. My friend also thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and we both consider himself to have had the perfect first trip.  Combining the Laser-light-show, a short city-walk (HIGHLY recommended if you live near an urban area, just walk around the main areas, you'll know why when your doing it) back to my apartment, where we watched a DVD psychedelic journey (Odyssey into the mind's eye, look for it!) and smoked a lot of extremely nice indoor.  The conversation was fantastic, and aforementioned it was much less difficult to maintain one than on acid.  I give it an A!







In Amsterdam, the law permits things that are unheard of in the states.  Like selling 2CT-7 over the counter. I brought 3, 8mg hits home, splitting them with a friend. 

In the beginning, there was a tryptamine like psychedelic felling that was strong.  I could get light visuals, and retiring to my bed with a blind fold I could only get simple , colorful, rotating patterns.  Usually when I am indoors on shrooms or LSD there is a hint of discomfort in my mind, but the 2CT-7 was very kind and gentle in is presentation.  It also had the pleasant stimulation of a Phenylethylamine, which gave us both a thirst for things to explore.  

The whole thing is that we both thought it was just interesting and fun, only realizing later how much the experience opened our eyes.  Wandering to the beach (I live on the coast of CA), I felt as if everything happening around me was happening just for me. Dogs joyfully chasing sticks, putting on a fantastic show. Pelicans diving into the water at just the right moment. The oil rigs would release a flame of excess gas, lighting up just for me.  The truth is the that things were happening around me that I had never seen before, and they were happening at just the right time.  I was so happy, because for a period of about an hour at the beach I felt that every thing going on was perfectly timed, done just for me.  Back in civilization, my interaction with other people was being carried out in a Zen like fashion.  I was fully stimulated, but also in a very special head-space. This orientation was so relaxed, any question directed at me was instantly answered.  My feelings about other people were enhanced as on ecstasy, and I feel my confidence was related to my conviction that nothing in the world that was going on was wrong in any way. I had a tremendous sense of purpose.

The entire experience lasted maybe 6-7 hours, and it would have been less if I didn't extend the experience through cannabis smoking. There was also a huge 'psychedelic afterglow' for both of us.  The optimism and awe which 2CT-7 inspired that day continued for the next day, dropping off by the third day.  2CT-7 was truly remarkable, and I feel very lucky to have been able to experience it.







I recently came into possession of some 2CT7, one of the more exotic but most highly rated compounds of Shulgin's 'PIHKAL'. He claims that it stands shoulder to shoulder with Mescaline, 2CB  and other established totems in the pantheon of entheogens in 'terms of richness of experience'. He also called it a 'great tool for introspection'.It sure is.

Most web postings wax euphoric about the visuals induced by 2CT7. I found the visuals rather tame actually. Some trails and undulations. Maybe it would be more visual at night or indoors (I took it in the morning on a sunny day at the beach). To put this statement into perspective, you should know that I once did 4 hits of strong blotter acid with no tolerance and saw a house turn into a beautiful liquid fountain of brick, so maybe I'm a bit jaded.  

What was interesting about it was the way it seemed to mimic candy flipping (tripping on a phenethylamine-eg. MDMA- and a tryptamine-eg.LSD- simultaneously)as it came on, which took about 2 hours. With most drugs, the fun doesn't start until the substance really hits you, but with 2CT7, the 'ride there' was quite extraordinary. I oscillated back and forth between MDMA and LSD like states of mind of increasing intensity for about two hours, ultimately arriving at a clear headed acid-like tryptamine-space(yes, I know the substance is pharmacolgically a phenethylamnine). 

I've noticed in the postings that many 2CT7 users get impatient waiting for the effects to come on and prematurely boost somewhere between the 1 and 2 hour mark, only to regret it a minute later when they start feeling their initial dose. They invariably enjoy the trip but vow to 'do less next time'. I noticed that most of these users start with from 15 mg to 25 mg and boost with about 10 mg at the 2 hour point, so I decided I would take 37.5 mg(carefully measured) at the outset and no more. 

What I noticed about this substance is that it hits you in waves of increasing intensity. As you reach each new level, you enter a short lived 'wacked' state marked by marked visuals. This invariably gives way to a clear headed, intellectually exhilirating mindspace as you accommodate yourself to increasingly complex and trippy modes of consciousness. The visuals dissipate and your thinking becomes incredibly clear and precise. This is the most intellectually stimulating compound I have taken in years; only acid may rival it in this respect. It is the sheer joy of mental clarity and rewarding introspection that is the hallmark of this substance-not visuals or 'emotional openness'. 

Another aspect of this substance that should be noted is that it periodically leaves you with the false impression that you are coming down, though these lulls invariably prove to be just 'calms before the storm'. I can definitely see why so many prematurely up the ante. Trust me, it is not necessary. Pick a reasonable dose(25 to 35 mg) and do not boost. Trust it to work its magic(it will).

In terms of duration, the 37.5 mg took about 2 hours to come on (with first alerts at about the half hour mark), peaked from hours 2 to 6 and spiraled down to baseline from hours 6 to 8. 

Interestingly enough, I was left with the impression that next time i should do more(perhaps as much as 50 mg).

All in all, a remarkable substance. I highly reccomend it. It combines the most rewarding aspects of an introspective acid session with a pleasant suggestion of MDMA-like activity. Top marks.







This is bad shit. the problem is you do not know what reality is or when it is. one minute you puff a joint with one friend the next minute your miles away at the beach sitting in the water. turning your head or sneezing will change where you are and what you are doing totally to where you dont know what reality is. a note if you are using the buddy system (highly recommended) your buddy will talk soooo fast you will not understand what there saying they will have no color in the eyes only black and talk in tongues. 

this stuff is not to be takin lightly. lsd does not hold a candle to the trickery which will be played by this plant. please be careful i was very lucky to have only drank the last quarter glass of bella donna tea. After jumping out of a moving car and running full speed through the bushes (i'm talking jungle terrain), my best friend was lost in the florida keys mangroves for almost 24 hours. he was half blind for about 3 days afterwards. best of luck. stick to reef!







This is my experience with the Datura or Angel Trumpets as we call them.

A few years back I had heard of the Angel Trumpet. A few persons I had known had done this and overdosed. But me being very curious told some friends and they went and picked some flowers. We boiled them and made a few gallons of them. We then mixed the juices diluted with a little water with tea or koolaid. We would drink it by the cup. It was the weirdest thing I had ever experienced. 

I was sitting in my room after I had done it, I then started hallucinating. I saw a monster come at me with a spike sticking out of its head. I saw a huge bird trying to peck my eyes out. I saw millions of cockroaches pouring out of my bathroom wall. I saw a alien when me and some of my friends walked to the corner store. I was having conversations with people who were not at my house and we were in a whole nother setting for example at school. I dont remember half of the things that happened.

My brother and his friends said one night when I did it they came in the house and saw me pouring coffee and hot boiling water and milk and sugar all over my kitchen floor. They asked me what I was doing and I replyed making coffee. I do not even remember this happening. When drinking this after a while it gave me the worst cottonmouth imaginable. My throat was so dry that it actually hurt.

We were only about 14 or 15 when we had discovered this. As a joke we made this guy drink 32 ounces of the angel trumpets. [Erowid Note : _Please_ don't dose others without their knowledge. This is extremely dangerous and uncool.  While this situation ended ok, it could have turned out much worse.] He was at our house his father came and picked him up. Next thing we know his father called my parents and said that the guy on the angel trumpets walked back to our house and he came looking for him and found him passed out in our front yard. He then brought him to the hospital which is near my house and he had overdosed. He came out of it though. I talked to him a few weeks later and he said that he saw a lot of the same things I had seen. Insects, he said I was in his room at the hospital talking to him amongst many other things. 

I really would not suggest doing this. Its really visual with all of the things you see but it can be so dangerous. You dont know what you are doing or where
you are. It is very frightening when you think about it.  Also if you do too much you can overdose like a few of the people I knew who did it, and if not you can end up making coffee on the floor! Or doing some other stupid things. I would stick to Pot or drugs you can control. For this you cannot control. 







I was at my friend's house and decided to try out angel trumpets.  I had heard of where a tree was and went and got two flowers, a bud of a flower, and 5 or 10 leaves.  I put about 2 cups of water in a pot and boiled all the shit for about 20 minutes.  I stained out the solids.  What was left was a yellowish liquid.  There was only a glass left now, and I drank a bit more than half of it.  Half an hour later I got kind of sleepy, and after that I the worst fucking cotton mouth of my life.  I felt kind of dizzy, and started getting a little confused.  All of the sudden I had to take a piss, but it was the hardest thing ever.  It took me about 20 minutes to finish taking the piss.  After that it was a big fucking rollercoaster ride.  

I did not know what day it was.  I asked my friend if it's 'today, yesterday, or tomorrow?'  I could swear that I had cups, pencils, or shit like that in my hand, but when I went to use them they were gone.  I kept seeing people that weren't there, and when they were gone I asked where they went.  About three hours later I decided to walk to my friend J's house.  I was walking down the road talking to him, but he wasn't there.  That was when the wierdest shit happened.  I looked at the wall by the sidewalk and saw my friend walking towards me.  He stepped out the wall and I asked whats up.  He looked at me, turned his head once or twice, and then melted back in the wall.  I was amazed.  A couple steps later I heard him call me, turned around and yelled what?  He looked at me turned around and then disappeared into the wall.  

After that I saw something on the ground.  It was a cat.  I went up to pet it, and it melted into a sprinkler head.  I saw the same cat about 5 more times, and each time it was different shit.  I got realy confused, but kept on walking.  All of the sudden I heard a scooter and it pulled up besides me.  It was my friend Lil'B.  He said wassup and then I said wassup and then I was redy to ask him for a ride and he vaporized into the air.  This was pretty wierd.  About twenty yards later was the scariest visual.  My dad appeared in front of me.  I stopped moving.  He asked me what the fuck I was on.  I got real scared, held my breath, and closed my eyes for 3 seconds.  When I opened them he was gone.  

The rest of the night i kept seeing people and animals that weren't there and kept thinking I was in different places.  I've done shrooms, I've done acid, I've done mescaline, and I've done Dramamine.  This shit was definitely the craziest.







I'm at a Rainbow Gathering and a desert thunderstorm is bearing down quickly, so I jump into the nearest available shelter, a teepee inhabited by some seriously Rainbowed-out characters, one of whom is a Polish sadhu, passing around a chillum and saying prayers to Shiva. Why not, I think, and take a couple of hits. The taste is tobaccoey, but more so... 'What's in this?' I ask. 'Ganja. And tobacco. And Datura.' Yow. Datura has always been on my 'Don't EVEN Go There' list. 

The buzz is like tobacco, only more so (which I've only ever had in very small doses, mixed with pot. I figure it can be okay to dance with the tobacco spirits, but don't invite them in or they'll eat you up from inside. I expect datura is also like this, only more so.) The storm blowing over as quickly as it came, I leave and go wandering. Its very subtle, just an added dimension to the marijuana high. 

At one point I'm on the trading trail where everyone has their blankets laid out with a profusion of hippie  trinkets, and a posse of armed forest service rangers comes riding through on horses. Some of the more agro hippies start yelling warnings and generally creating a disturbed vibe in what had up to then been a very peaceful atmosphere. A few minutes later, a dust devil whips across the trail, touching down right in the area where the disturbance had occured and... The atmosphere is restored to its previous peace. The wind has cleared out the bad energies, or so the datura informs me (not as a voice speaking to me, but rather as catalyst for thinking along channels that might not otherwise have been available able to me.) 

Later, I'm looking down a valley at another rainstorm, knowing how good it will feel to the land to get some rain after being inhabited and trampled by ten thousand hippies...I feel the datura has allowed me to become aware of the interactions of elemental energies in my environment, which is something I hadn't much thought about up to that point. This was 5 years ago, and I haven't tried it again since, but I could see going into the wilderness (desert seems most appropriate...) and smoking a bowl of pot and maybe a postage stamp-sized piece of datura leaf.

Folks, if you must play with datura, play safe - tiny amounts in a good setting, and smoke it, don't eat it. 







I started to snort cocaine about a year and a half ago it started with smoking pot and a friend of mine offered some coke to me and i agreed to take it.  After six months of it i realized that i was hooked on it so for the past year i have been quitting. just last week i threw away the last of my shit and it has been hell but i think that i can make it.  nobody really knows about it but a few close friends who have been very supportive of me quitting. i finally told my girlfriend about it and we agreed to break up till i got all the way clean. i hope and i pray that i can come clean and finish college and put it all behind me. if anyone reads this don't even start. it only takes one time and it ruins your life so bad it's not as good as it sounds and it's not cool you'll just end up hiding it from your friends and being ashamed of it







While in college hanging with some friends we decided that our normal drug use wasnt good enough anymore(bud, acid, special k, peyote and mescaline) so we decided to get some coke off a friend of mine although ive done once our twice before in sexual experiences we decide to get an 8-ball since i was the only one to have done it before and i knew it would go.  Well we all snorted a fair share each there were 4 of us so we had about 10-15 bumps a piece and we were flying high we sat there and talked 100 words a second and smoked about 4 packs of cigarettes each in about the 3 hours the 8-ball lasted. well at this point we were fiending pretty hardcore so i developed a good cure we rolled two joints one with some coke and a regular bone. We smoked both at the same time goingback and forth and while the coke joint suppressed our hunger the regular joint made our low not as bad the pot kicked effect and we all fell asleep and the next morning i never felt better in my entire life since i was up for 20 some hours and waking up at 8am for my first class i woke up refreshed and energized and never had urges to do coke all the time. 

I still do it on occasion now but using my joints i never seem to fiend after hitting my bumps. i dont condone drug use in any way and my story is for informational purposes only. 








Well, after a rather rousing show at a local club, I went back to a friend's home and utilized a Fifth of Whiskey to an unexpected end.  Over the course of about an hour, I consumed the entire fifth straight and proceeded to become very drunk.  What must be understood is that I was doing this drinking only for the sake of being drunk.  I had not intented, nor had I ever heard of Alcohol (besides in the Uncharist) used spiritually.  

Well...I, needless to say, felt very groggy very quickly.  I sat down in an overstuffed armchair with my feet up and instead of passing out, as would be typical, I felt myself 'slip' into a quasi-trance state.  With my eyelids fluttering, I was still perfectly aware of my body; sensations were normal (I could feel the cool evening breeze flowing through an open window).  But quickly, I had the sensation of moving OUT of my body, away and upwards through the top of my head (an odd one of a kind feeling).  I only then, after realizing I was in fact FEELING this that I began to actually SEE myself below.   Keep in mind this was like a division of consciousness here; I could still feel my body and feel myself away from it.  

At this point I made the choice to concentrate on myself aloof from my body.  Well, quickly I was flying away from my body, away from the house...like I was being pulled away instead of directing myself away.  Well, I was pulled out into the sky, away from the city, away from the state away from the country until I was actually in space flying away from Earth and the Moon.  I went through a few asteroid fields as I cleared the solar system and continued outwards with increasing speed.  Moving away from the expasiveness of the galaxy, I watched it solidify into the spiral that characterizes it. 

On the same tolken, I was soon far enough away that It was like a mere star and every other galaxy about was the same; reduced to single points of light.  These too then began to coalesce until I was looking back at the universe at the point of the Big Bang; looking at the waves of energy that themselves created and formed into what appeared to be gyrating atoms.  These atoms TOO solidify into matter...and this matter, as I removed myself away from it further and further...I realized was a hair on my head!  I then gasped and sat straight up in my chair...laughing uncontrollably.  The entire experience took me less than a couple of minutes (by looking at the clock).







Put 10 grams of powdered, non-grade-A Amanita powder into 24 capsules.

t -1 hour - took 1 dramamine tablet.
t0 - Swallowed the caps all at once on an empty stomach.
t1 - Vision blurred; tended to relax to near-focus only.  Extreme salivation, extreme sweating, soggy all around.  Showered.  Prepared oatmeal to nibble to hold off possible nausea.
t2-t6 - waited and waited, in this swamp, but the mental aspects never appeared.  No nausea.  Disappointing.  What to do with many, many more sub-grade A.M. capsules.

Warning: this caused swelling under tonsils, for two days.  Worse, this caused something like an ear infection which lasted 1 month and continues.  Want to take some metallic orange-gold grade-A caps, but afraid of ear problems.  This material must be the most unreliable in the world.

Absolutely recommend that you do not use this material until you have ample cannabis to counteract the salivation and possible nausea, and hopefully counter the sweating. A.M. + cannabis is a good pair, but not A.M. alone.










 [Erowid Note: 
Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe recreational use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.] 

In college my friends Craig, Erik, Todd and myself decided to purchase 4 cans of Freon from the local auto parts store and inhale one can per person.  I won't go into the details of anyone's experience save for Craig.

Immediately after inhaling the Freon he began to salivate and speak like 'Lucifer'...no lie!  His voice became very deep and onimous and he began babbling this and that...that is, nothing profound enought to capture my attention as I was under the influence myself.  Then he said something I will never forget, 'Look, I'm a plane!'

He extended his arms from his side and began to run around in circles.  The joy on his face was readily obvious, that is until he 'crash landed' onto his face with his tongue sticking out.  Needless to say we had him to the hospital to repair his tongue which was severed.

All in all, I would not recommend Freon to the light hearted.  And it may just be moot as you currently need a license to purchase it anyway.  As Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five once said, '...don't do it!'








We started just before work.  I was bored and feeling strangely adventurous.  My friend Amy was having a cigarette and she pulled out a dime-sized ziploc with a lot of small white pills in it, took 4, and handed me 3.  After we'd taken them, she explained that they were basically a natural form of speed.  We swallowed them with cafe lattes.  

She'd been taking ephedrine for a day or so, and told me that she felt it in perhaps 15 minutes.  I didn't feel anything, and that was all right.  Then about half an hour later, I got really speedy.  I felt a nearly overwhelming urge to move obscenely fast, and had to grit my teeth to remain calmly behind the cash register.  My fingers raced when I swiped credit cards, ripped receipts, etc.  I was enjoying myself very much, too much to be at work.

Then perhaps another 15 minutes later, (1 hour after taking 75mg) I felt a need to suppress my vigor.  It wasn't a strong paranoia or fear, but more a determination to act as normally as possible.  I spoke slowly, moved deliberately, and began to feel very lazy and physically tired.  When I took a break my body felt much as it has after an intense workout of sculling or biking.  Putting my feet up on a chair as I sat brought the muscles an intensely pleasurable relaxation comprable only to slipping into a cool bed after a long day of hard physical activity.  I still wanted to get up and sprint.  This was about 2 hours after the initial dose.

After my break, I took 3 more pills (75mg).  I perked up about 30 minutes later.  The day flew by and before we knew it we were at the gas station buying a fresh bottle.
 
We popped the pills all night with friends while drinking, usually 2 at a time, every 30-60 minutes.  We were drinking margaritias and martinis.  I was incredibly awake.  After having 4 or 5 drinks, I was closing my eyes with weariness, but remained totally mentally awake and aware of my surroundings.  With my eyes shut I felt as though I were in a convertible moving very fast.  It was a good feeling, although mildly frightening.  Amy said she felt like she was rolling. 

At 5 am we had each consumed about 14 pills (350mg) since getting home, and about 8 drinks, but also a bunch of water.  Our housemate Karel took us to the diner.  We were all wired.  Our hands were shaky, our bodies pleasantly tired, and our minds fully alert.  Karel hadn't taken as much as we had, and so he had a full breakfast.  Amy and I slid dollar bills onto the table and contentedly sipped at raspberry iced tea, each finishing 2 glasses (30 oz) in about 1.5 hours.  I felt perfectly fed the entire time.  Each new sip of tea filled a tiny empty spot in my full stomach.  

After the sun had risen we drove home and crashed.  The hangover was phenomenal.  I woke up at 2 pm, after about 7hr of sleep, felt horrbly tired, my head ached, and I went back to sleep.  The sleep was vague and interrupted.  I laid for hours opening my eyes intermittently to find that lots of time had passed as though I were asleep.

We got up around 5pm and started it all again, taking another 20 pills each (500mg).  We also snorted a couple of ground-up pills as a joke to scare a friend.  They really burned, and I felt the effects very quickly, perhaps a minute or two after doing the lines, but they weren't particularly strong.  We didn't drink much that night, but the wasted feeling when I woke up the next afternoon was the same.  

I've since used ephedrine to stay up writing a paper, once with a friend to party all night, and taken the pills singly (25mg) before lifting weights a few times a week because several magazines advised doing so to raise the amount you can lift.

In conclusion, I've found this drug to be innocuous enough in responsibly small doses (25-50mg) not too close to bedtime. It's pleasant, while shortlived in larger doses.  I easily sleep for 15 hours after using it to stay awake, even for a short time.  This hangover effect is bad enough to make using it more of a 'last resort' than a diversion.  

When you take large doses, ephedrine makes your heart beat rapidly.  You aren't hungry, and don't care to eat. It's easy to become dependent on it to stay awake at college.   It makes me very alert mentally, and physically speedy.  Then I quickly crash physically, within a few hours, stay mentally sharp, and sometimes feel mentally 'raw' - angry or irritated for no reason, to my alarm.  I am usually a very pacific individual, so much so that people often mistake my demeanor for a fabulous roll on e.  

So don't take too much.  The ephedrine described here is sold in bottles of 60 pills as a decongestant for asthma under the brand name '2-way' at some gas stations and many truck stops, for about $8.








One day my roommate and I got it in our heads to do some ether... he had taken 100 mL pure diethyl ether from his college chem lab.

We poured it onto a rag and inhaled the vapors. It smells like turpentine and is a little difficult to take big breaths of at first. Seconds after I took a few lungfuls I felt the effects, which were mainly a mild euphoria and blurred vision, which lasted a few minutes.

It was kinda fun, but nothing great- so we decided that we must not be doing enough. A few nights later I decided to sit down and get crazy with it. I buried my nose deep into the rag, to the point where it burned slightly as I took my first few breaths. I really had to inhale sharply in order to breathe enough in before it all evaporated away. Again, the same effects - stronger but still not what I expected. I figured I might as well huff the rest, have a few cheap thrills, and be done with it.

I walked over to where my roommate was and began to do more. I poured about 10 mL out onto the rag at a time, huffed until it had all evaporated, and then waited a few minutes to come down before my next dose. I poured another 10 mL out and huffed the rest of that... by the time I had inhaled about 3/4 of what was on the rag I realized I had blacked out between breaths of ether, while I was talking to my roommate. I was wobbling heavily, I couldn't move, and I was talking but only gibberish was coming out. I tried to step forward and nearly fell. I felt an intense euphoria, which lasted for about 4 or 5 minutes. The loss of motor skills lasted about 45 seconds.

I continued to do more, taking a few breaths of ether every 5 minutes, or whenever the euphoria started to wear off. Each time I got the euphoria back, but I never lost my motor skills or blacked out again. The desire to do more immediately was pretty strong but went away a few minutes after the effects wear off.

It was a fun experience once I finally went all out and did enough. The smell is terrible, and it lingers slightly for the rest of the night, but it worth it if you can inhale enough to get to that second plateau.

My first experience with freon was excellent.  I tried it after an awesome night at a rave.  You get the same 'wa-wa' effect as a single n2o ballon except with just a more little potency.  I soon found myself emptying whole airconditioning systems in a single evening.  The most difficult problem I had was getting the dose right, too much and you just black out (stitches in the head suck, had my share), not enough and you get the 'wa-wa's'.  Somewhere in the middle was an excellent hallucent plain. I found the best was with my eyes closed.  I could see the surroundings around me..walls, cars, cardboard-boxes, ect., but with an amazing  brilliant color coating (much better than any acid trip I've had) like the background from a Grateful Dead poster.  

I had many 'friends' visit during my 30-60 second highs.  Voices and faces would come in and go.  The other bad part was the occasional (every 2-3 days or evenings) vomiting.  This is caused from the oil and other impurities not found in n2o)  I was usually too high to care, I have a weak stomach anyhow (more than 3-4 beers an hour makes me sick).  

I did find myself addicted for a couple of months, although it was mostly a mental addiction not physical.  I was a junky, if you can become one off of freon.  I was spending 75% of my free time huffing on any A/C that wasn't in plain sight of a street.  Mostly at schools or churches that i knew no one would be at in the middle of the night or Saturday afternoon.  I eventually did get caught by the police (simple tresspassing and destruction of property, no charges pressed, the cops didn't really know what to do with me), I was making too much noise behind a business that backs up to a neighborhood.  

The reasons I choose freon was of it's accessibility (every car, home, refrigerator, trailer has some, you just have to have a pair of pliars and a drinking straw or ink pen), it's duration (all motor skills return in 5-15 minutes, vs. alcohol 2-6 hours), and it doesn't come out in blood or urine tests.  

Some suggestions: don't do it at a location that you frequent (your house or car), freon is expencive to replace. Second do it with a friend in case you black out so they can keep an eye on you. Third sit down, I had stitches in the back and top of my head twice.  I have since turned 21 and can get alcohol for myself or find acid, although i still enjoy the occational 'binger'.







I do not know if I should consider this experience a drug overdose or poisoning... At a friend's house, he is an EMT offering me GHB for the first time. I trusted him, being in the Navy, and he told me to take the reccomended dosage for a female my size of 4cc (4 ml). I was told not to eat for 4 hours prior to taking the drug, which I hadn't so it would work well. 

I did not know anything about the drug GHB and at first I did not feel anything after taking the dose. I took a total of 18 more cc when he wasn't looking. 7 minutes later, I felt a strong and sudden reaction to the drug. I felt very dizzy and drunk and my vision was choppy and wavy. I told the EMT friend I was feeling it. I remember him pulling me into the bedroom to have sexual affairs and I remember acting very silly. The radio was on and I could hear the music around me very clearly and loud. I know my orgasm lasted nearly a minute and was very hard to achieve. It was more intense then any other time in my life. I left the room after having sex. 

Still awake and wanting to talk, I sat down on the floor with my knees to my chest for about a minute, and the next thing I knew I was waking up the next morning... As I awoke, my eyes were rolling in the back of my head, I was unable to remember where I was, I was literally freezing cold, my teeth chattering. I had to urinate right away so I crawled to the bathroom and pulled myself onto the toilet. I felt so nausiated, my teeth still going, and my skin ice cold. The room was spinnng very fast. 

The last dose I had taken of the GHB was at 4:30 am. When I awoke suddenly, it was only 8:30. The EMT friend was no where to be found, yet a letter was left for me... 10 minutes later, my eyes no longer fluttering, I began to read. 'I had to leave for work, please take this Thermadrene pill so you can drive yourself home. Please sleep as long as you need to in order to drive safely.' I drank some water, still below normal body temperature, wrapped myself up and went to sleep again. 

Though I had a lot of trouble falling asleep. I was out in 20 minutes after laying there. 6 hours later, I felt okay to drive home and did so. 

Calling the EMT friend, I asked what had happened to me. He said when I left the room, only minutes later, he came out to bring me into the bed where I can sleep comfortably, I was choking on my own tongue, about to swallow it. He layed me down on my side with a pillow and blanket, in a position where he knew I would be okay. He checked my vital signs, I was going to be okay. 

I would call it an overdose, but since I woke up the way I did, so dissoriented and eyes rolling in back of my head, I didn't know if this would actually be poisoning... For the next 3 days I was depressed, forgetfull, had diareah, ate nothing, talked to no one. I eventually came out of the GHB trance after 3 days.







I had for the last two years a psychological addiction as well as a physical addiction to the substance known as GBL my brand was Renewtrient I loved that shit.  The problem was when I first started using it socially it was cool it took away all my worries and stress, then came the part were I needed it more and more to function daily to sleep properly my dosage sky rocketed through the roof. If this sounds familiar to anyone reading this and you found yourself out of control like I did or you still are and want to stop here are some great ideas that work and not just for me but about 15 other people I have already helped kick the habbit.

Monitor your intake for about 2-3 days find out exactly your intake per day, get ready for about 3 days of feeling some real fucking stress when you take your dosage and cut it in half and I mean in half.  For the next 2-3 days you will feel alot of anxiety but no where near the mental hell if you quit cold turkey, after these 3 days the anxiety, nervousness,and restlessness will end and from there only take the GBL to fight of the minor weird feelings that accompany any withdrawal symptom.

A few years ago, I used to inhale gas for a buzz.  If you are thinking of trying this, let me tell you.  The effects are AWESOME, short lived, but NOT AT ALL worth the damage it does.  

Good expierence:
On night I was home alone with my brother.  There was nothing to do so I went out to the shed filled a baggie 1/4 full of gas and started huffing away.  I must have been huffing for about 10 minutes when I had the wierdest expierence I've ever had.  I was sitting in the back room buzzing my brains out and I passed out.  I had a dream that an apparition or ghost floated to where I was laying and took my hand.  It told me it wanted to show me something and led me into the front room.  I then woke up and found my self laying on the couch in the front room.  In writing, it sounds kinda lame, but expierencing that BLEW my mind because it seemed so damn real.  Since then I have tried a few other drugs including weed, lsd, speed, and have never had an expierence like that where I completely lost touch with reality.

Bad experience:
I was out in the shed huffing gas out of a detatchable vacume tube when the tube slipped down into the gas and I sucked a whole mouthful and swallowed it.  After the effects wore off (about 2 minutes) I realized what I had done and began to panic.  I thought I was going to f@!# die of poisoning. So after about 10 minutes of puking my guts up (and by the way, puking up gasoline is somthing you NEVER want to do, let me tell you about the burning all through your nose and throat and the smell/taste)I went on the Internet and looked up gas poisoning and found a remedy to counteract it.  It consisted of something like burnt toast, Milk of Magnesia, milk, and some other ingredients.  Well, I thought it was a little weird, but I'm alive still so I guess it worked.  After that expierence, I could not stand the smell of gasoline.  Even to this day, I still feel a little nauseous pumping gas.  And I have never since stooped to the inhalent level of getting high.  All of that was not worth the trauma and the fear of dying. 

LSD and THC ONLY for me ;)













I had to use N2O about 100 times before I began to feel what I am going to describe to you.

It all starts with one balloon full.  That is all I need to feel the infinity effect.  Every time I do it.  It gets stronger.  The effect of the time before it seems like a microscopic dot.  It is nothing.  With each experience, I see the bigger picture.  

You will step back and see what you thought was the highest you had ever been is really nothing.  And it will work like that for infinity.  You can't begin to imagine what the next 'Bigger Picture' will look like.  It will be a thousand of your thoughts all in one.  The highest you have ever been will fold into just a fraction of your current experience.  It almost scares me.  You travel to a level of hundred for example.  Then it's like that hundred is inside of another hundred hundred the next time you do it.  One universe on top of another.  You can see infinite feelings.  And infinite worlds.  You will only understand what I am saying when you see it.  And when you do, you will get a feeling in your stomach like you have unlocked the answer to the meaning of life.  Like you can see what infinity is.  

But unfortunately, you will loose your insight on it as soon as the high is gone.  Only when you get high again will it return.  It is a realization.  And you can realize it over and over again.  You can never end it.  And when you think you have.  That one experience will take you a level you could not even imagine before.  All the feelings are the different but they are the same.  The are different because they are different infinities of themselves.  Everything is in everything.  All feelings are forever and infinite.  

Try this --> write down what you are thinking while the high is at its peak.  Make a sentence.  When the high is gone, it will look and sound stupid.  Then get high again and read it.  You will know while you are high what it means and you will then understand it.  But at the same time, you will know when you come down.  You won't understand what you know at that moment.  You can even try to add onto the sentence.  Write a book.  A book only someone high on nitrous oxide will understand.  

And for anyone, who has had this experience, think about this.  When you see the bigger picture.. the infinity of it all... how do you know... right now as you read this.. and as you live on earth... if it is just another stage of the infinity and you just have not gone down to the next level... and as of now... we can't even grasp what the next level could possible be....

Maybe I will see you in the infinity....







After partaking in nitrous countless times, I've had a few thoughts about the characteristic high. To me, I think nitrous removes conciousness deep into your memories, or deep into your body. Yet it can also connect you with the Eternal Present, often spoken of by spiritual masters.  I always have an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia, partly serene and partly sad.  I still can't figure out what I'm remembering.  I think it's probably a great awe I have for life, and all aspects of life.  For instance, while in the nitrous conciousness, I thought about a Mack dumptruck.  I realized how my experience of it is only typical to my existence in this time on earth.  I've seen dumptrucks on the highway all of my life, yet I've never thought of how precious that experience is.

Another example I can remember happened when I was holding a previously discharged nitrous canister in my hand.  It was still rather cold, somewhat frosty to the touch.  But when I was high, I couldn't fully register the feeling of 'cold in my left hand.'  It was almost like, 'I'm cold, hard and solid.' I felt like I knew what the conciousness of a rock was. Cold, hard, solid.  I felt like I knew exactly what rocks thought.

Sometimes it's scary, because it makes me feel like I'm going to die.  It's not me who's afraid to die, but my body.  And I can feel it alot if I do it many times.  I get this overwhelming feeling of being a hedonist, and my body is telling me to stop.  My body is apprehensive of the thought of dying, but the Love that I sometimes experience alomost makes me cry.  One time when I was the nitrous conciousness I was in my friends car in a Wendy's drive-through.  While he was busy ordering food, I was looking at this little bush planted in a smallish median.  It looked like nobody ever payed any attention to it, and I felt so sorry for it. I felt like I could cry.  But the bush didn't care, it doesn't even think about that.  It just lives in the Now, it just exists.  Just like the feeling of the cold canister/rock.  It's best described as Supreme Being.  Sometimes I wish I could switch off my concious rational mind at will, because it seems like the more simpler an intelligence is, the more powerful it is.  I know it sounds odd, but think about( if you can remember) when your high.
















Sunday night at a friend's party, I tried E for the first time. My boyfriend rolls quite often and wanted me to try it also. I had been thinking about it and after researching it decided to try it. I only took a half though because I had read somewhere that it was a good idea to only do half your first time. I am really glad I only took half. I took it at about 1am and then went to a room to smoke a few blunts w/ some friends. It seems like it only took about 20 minutes before the pill took effect. The only thing I remember is sitting on the bed and starting to rub my arms and head and that it feel really good. 

Then someone else started to massage me. I think. I really can't remember who, but I think my boyfriend did first. It wouldn't have been really cool, but when ever someone touched me it was sooo intense that I couldn't really think. The next thing I remember is my boyfriend being on top of me massaging my whole body. I was really into it. But then I wigged out. I got up and started telling everyone not to leave me alone w/ him. And not to let me sleep w/ him. I am a virgin and I want to wait til I am married, so that is why I was friggin out. The rest of the night I stayed w/ other people and really didn't stay alone w/ him until I felt I could control myself. Which took about 5 hours til I could think if someone touched me. It still felt good, but I could function. I am not sure if I will ever do E again. I would like too, but I can't until I can trust myself to not put myself in a situation to sleep w/ someone. Everyone at the party looked after me, but I should have told them what the deal was before I took the pill. I will know that if there is a next time though. So my advice to everyone out there, do the research, roll w/ people you trust, and trust yourself. 

Everybody get your roll on!  :)>







It was the second time I used nitrous.  I knew a tank was at this party..everyone did.  The first time I used nitrous was a month and a half before this party.  I was very nervous and I didn't totally inhale fearing the experience it would provide.  I have an addictive personality and knew I would probably love it.

My boyfriend and I got a deal for $50 for the both of us, unlimited balloons the whole night.  I smoked pot before hand and this intensified the effect so much more. Once I started with the balloons, I could not stop. At a couple points in the night I was found with two balloons at one time. The feeling is compared to the very beginning of a good 'roll.'  That is why you crave more.  The warm, euphoric, lethargic, sedation felt wants to be repeated over and over and over until you are dragged away.  Oddly enough, I had visions of when I was a child.  Each time I did nitrous, I had a vision of a baby carriage which was a picture I had in my room of when I was young.  Not easy for many people to understand when I tell them.  It just set me free, how I felt as a little girl. It felt good to stop for a moment and come back to reality, realizing it might be time to stop...but not being able to.  The honest after feeling is just one of sedation and true 'air-headedness.'  I found myself calling my mother trying to have a decent conversation to make myself feel normal again the next day.

This was the most I have ever and ever will do.  Each time I did this inhalant I had an unexpected problem sleeping.  I did not remember falling asleep the night I did it and I had trouble falling asleep the night after.  It may have been my mind wondering and worrying if my lost brain cells will ever return?  I mean, we use less than 3% of our brains anyway, right....:)









Of all the drugs I've tried, the most indepth and mentally tiring drug is DXM. Dextromethorphan (Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide, usually when found in over-the-counter medications).

You can find DXM in the local supermarket under the label 'Robotussin maximum strength cough' for approximately $1.00 per ounce. It is perfectly legal (at least, now it is...you never know what Newt Gingrich will do next), and is not for the weak-of-heart, at least not in the upper plateaus (Refer to the DXM FAQ in the Lycaeum and/or Erowid for more information about plateaus).

I contribute this, these experiences of mine, to the Vaults of Erowid in order to further educate those who are seeking knowledge of DXM. Sure, you could be a rocket scientist for all I care, you still don't know shit until you've had the experience itself. I have been to the 4th plateau and back, which speaks for itself. 

Really, the main questions you should ask yourself before trying DXM are: Am I afraid of my own mind? Am I afraid to look deeply into it? Am I afraid of leaving my body and existance behind? You can expect all of these to happen on an upper-plateau trip, for they most likely will. This contribution is meant to scare those who cannot handle DXM and to encourage those who can to think about trying it. It's all a personal choice, because if you were pushed into it, believe me, you won't like it.

The thing about DXM that first interested me was it's spiritual depth at the upper plateaus. After a bit of reading the FAQ, I went to Publix and picked up an 8oz. bottle of Robo. Throughout the week after, I experimented with 2 plateau-1 trips and 1 plateau-2 trip. I thought just then that I knew exactly what would happen at the high 3rd plateau, but I was completely wrong. 

After about another week, my friend and I got together and bought 2 8oz bottles and quickly arrived back at his house. We saluted each other, then clinked the bottles together and pointed the bottoms up as we guzzled it down. It took about 10 minutes to slowly finish each bottle with the least amount of nausea possible. We both had taken 8oz of Robo. About 15 minutes later, I was pacing nervously around his room, slightly off-balance while he was anticipating his nausea and relaxing on his chair. I almost puked on his floor as I held it painfully down, twice. As soon as it settled in my stomach again, I ran into the bathroom, only to be hit by the second plateau right at the doorway. I didn't know what was happening as I leaned into the bathroom, staring at the floor, but the puke that I saw directly below me answered my question. I had to clean it up later. I slowly but surely stepped over the puke and sat down on his bathtub next to his toilet, and forced myself to puke once again. With that, I sat there for what seemed 10 years. After about 15 minutes (2 years),  I saw my friend run by the bathroom into the other bathroom and heard him puking into the toilet. He had his coming as well. After that, he went into his room again and started playing nitrous oxide on his playstation. The next string of events seem like only a novel could explain them, but I have trouble finding the right words to remember them by.

After a short while later, the 3rd plateau snuck up on me and grabbed me by the balls. I sat there as my body went almost completely numb and my mind drew a complete blank. All sensory input was diminished as I could only help but pay attention to nothing. I had the constant idea of my imminent death, but I did not fear it. It was simply a fact in my head. I could not feel fear. Only sorrow. But, the sorrow quickly diminished as the 4th plateau rolled in. It most surely shouldn't have rolled in, according to my weight/dosage calculations, but it did for whatever reasons. I had even checked and identified most symptoms of the 4th plataeu from William White's excellent DXM FAQ. I had complete amnesia for an hour. I forgot who I was, where I was, why I was there, or why I was alive. There must have been some reason for my life; it was on the tip of my tongue, but I had no idea whatsoever. The sense of sorrow quickly diminished as if I was a broken robot waiting for it's dismantlement. No emotion, complete apathy. A sense that I had never before had. I looked into the mirror while my vision was working every now and then, and wondered who that face belonged to, because it was so familiar. At times, my friend would stumble by the bathroom to check on me, because he knew there were razors and the like in there. Even if I had wanted to use them, I couldn't summon the willpower to move my arm. I don't know how I kept my balance on the side of the tub, nor how I answered my friend when my mouth wouldn't move, but he seemed to be satisfied. 

What was even more interesting were the short periods of time (felt like 2 minutes each) where I would float over my own body, in the top corner of the roof and watch my body stare at the wall as my friend would try to talk to me. He would give up, then come back 10 minutes later and try again in vain. Once the knowledge of who I was returned to me in a gust of cold wind, I looked up with double-vision to see 2 of my friend standing there, trying to talk to me. I had to focus on my hearing to understand what he said. He wanted me to go into the other room with him and watch some TV and look out the window. I agreed only because he had a garbage bag with him just incase I had to vomit again, because I told him that I couldn't feel any of my body, so I couldn't know if my stomach was upset or not. It took an eternity and no time at the same time to speak. I couldn't tell. So, with my eyes plastered open as if I had drank 25 cups of coffee (As it makes you), I took giant, balanced steps out of the bathroom into his room, being ever so careful to lean against things so I wouldn't fall down the stairs. 

Once I arrived in his room, I wondered how I got there. I was supposed to be in the bathroom. Could I have walked into his room and not remembered it 2 seconds later? I sat down very slowly and placed the garbage bag under my head incase. For the rest of the trip, it wasn't neccessary, but I didn't know that I wouldn't be vomiting anymore. The fact that I vomited was a big factor in the mood of the trip. After I stepped down to the 3rd plateau, I found myself with a little more sanity now. I stared out the window with my wide eyes, watching a palm tree slightly sway in the breeze. I still had the double-vision, so it was hard to focus on anything, but easy to focus on nothing and everything at the same time. After I plummetted down to the 2nd plateau, we went to another friend's house. We described what happened to him, and he was eager to try it (despite my warnings). He never told me what happened to him, but he's been doing it ever since. As I sobered up, I was left with a ray of hope for myself - the fact that I was alive. It was sort of a challenge. My halfway insane mind had lost the battle against itself, but not the war. It took about half a year for me to gather up enough courage to try it once again.

This time, it was another one of my friends who had never tried it before and me. We hunted around supermarkets at 11:00 PM, trying to find a way to turn $11.06 into 16 oz. of Robo. It involved a lot of careful planning and some shoplifting, but we did it. We dosed at about 12:45 AM that night...it was a night that I will never forget. It was the night that I overcame my own mind. I had won the battle. At about 1:15, my friend vomited violently and commented, 'I feel like shit.' I had advised him to sit over his bucket and to try to calm down, but it didn't work. I, however, had the mental control that night to keep myself from vomiting. There were times that I thought I was going to vomit, but I was gladly mistaken and nothing came out. I eased myself into the journey. I forget the transition from the 2nd plateau to the third, but it clearly happened.

I looked down at my watch at what seemed 2 minutes later and it was 2:30 AM. At this point, I was almost there. I had a panic attack, even though I didn't know it. My heart just started pounding violently and I started to sweat. Even though I was completely calm, I think it was my brain trying to tell me that there was something wrong - like I didn't know it. It elapsed after about 30 seconds of pounding, and then my trip took off. As I reached high 3rd plateau, I no longer saw through my eyes (Whether they were open or closed - I didn't know). I am still trying to sort out what happened that night. I can't remember much, only vague details. I had found myself back in the place that I was in 6 months before. I was deep inside myself, taking a stroll through my own consciousness. Occasionally, something loud enough would snap me back into a semi-dazed reality, mostly my friend tossing and turning on his bed trying desperately to go to sleep. I wanted so badly to try and comfort him, but my mouth couldn't form the words. 

As I was enveloped in the swirling stream of thoughts and memories intertwined, I felt as if I was a boat. I struggled to steer myself through them using the right route, only to find myself back in my old situation...will I die? Will I be a vegetable? Obviously, no, because DXM didn't do that to people (At least not that kind of dosage), but my drug-induced mind was still wondering. At that moment, I used my strength and knowledge and looked to God for guidance. I felt as though I had a connection with God, one that I had never before had. Imagine the numbers 1 through 10, 1 being no DXM at all, and 10 being a fatal overdose of DXM...All numbers greater than 1 bring you that much closer to death, and in that, bring you that much closer to God. The upper plateaus are most definitely meant for spirituality. I was being cradled by God as he protected me from myself. I was comforted, more than I ever had been before. If I could cry that night, I would have. 

I was continually searching through my mind, trying to reorganize it to help me understand the answers better. It was like hypnosis. It was beautiful. I saw anything and everything, I was the master and the slave of the universe. And I would give almost anything to remember what I had done to myself that night. My thoughts, my personality, my general ego had changed somewhat since that night, for the better. I wish I knew exactly what I did to change myself. All I know was that it was definitely worth it. After all that had happened, I looked at my watch and noticed that it was 2:40. After another 10 years of swimming through my mind, my watch read 2:50. After 2:50, I just stopped looking at my watch until I had lowered to the 2nd plateau. I couldn't look at my watch anyways, because I had double-vision after I had returned to reality on a 3rd plateau. I couldn't focus in on anything at all. 

As I said, I forget much of what happened. Somewhere between the 2nd and 1st plateaus of coming down, my friend and I had a few short, numb conversations. It turned out that he thought he was going to die, like I did at first. He had the same terrible first trip that I had and has told me that he didn't want to do it again. I really don't know what to expect...whether or not he will try it again. The effects vary from mind to mind, and DXM is definitely not for everyone. You have to be strong-minded and sane, or you might end up a looney at the state-mental institution. I saw it as one of the possibilities (one of the routes that my boat could take) that I could have made. Complete insanity. It had it's benefits, and was slightly tempting, but I had plans for my life. I still have plans for my life. I have enrolled myself in a private college (finally) to get an associate's degree in computer applications. That last DXM trip made me realize that I don't need drugs (Besides the occasional beer at a special occasion, and maybe a geltab or two once a year) to live. I can meditate and bring myself to a psychedelic high whenever I want to. I just wanted an easy 'high.' 

To sum it all up, I think I have finally found the peace that I deserve and have suffered for all my life. I don't know what to expect down the road, but I'm sure I can make it. If you want to take DXM, then PLEASE keep it to a recreational (lower plateau) dose, unless you know what you are doing. From what I saw on both occasions, DXM is a dangerous drug. With DXM, you can re-arrange your consciousness, whether you know it or not, or whether you know how to or not. Good luck everyone, and God bless.









Let me preface this posting with this:  I am not a chemist, I took chemistry in high school and for a short stint in college.  I would like to believe I used a reasonably scientific method for my testing and would encourage the same of anyone else who tries anything of this nature.  Of course I post these results only as a detailed informational guide for anyone who is interested in attempting this legal (as far as I know) extraction process.

FAMILY : Convolvulaceae 
GENUS : Ipomoea  
SPECIES : violacea 
LSA extraction into Ethonal base (190proof Everclear)
-----------------------------------------------------------
5:40PM  Ground 378 seeds to powder

5:45PM  Placed powder into 296ml of Naptha / shook solution vigorously

5:50PM  Set aside MG powder in Naptha bath (~20min)

6:12PM  Began filtration process through coffee filter NOTE: very slow

6:34PM  Still filtering, process is extremely slow, down to large pieces now

6:49PM  The extraction process is complete, sandlike seed remains placed directly under 40watt bulb (Desk lamp 2-3' from substance) on several layers of thick paper towel

NOTE:	The sticky gum on masking tape is turned into a gooey substance by Naptha, remember not to use it again

7:03PM 	Using a pocketknife, I cut/mixed the sand/powder substance to ensure even distribution, and that everything was dry before the alcohol bath

NOTE:	VERY VERY Few of the people that tried extracting LSA from morning glory seeds that posted to the 'net actually followed the directions given in the FAQ.  Aside from the nausea elimiting step, almost all neglected the grind to a powder and soak in strong (read 190prf) alcohol to extract the LSA as it is soluable in an ethanol based liquid.  The closest thing to the aformentioned procedure,  was someone who decided to evaporate off some of the alcohol to rid it of an ether smell.  I can assume he evaporated off much of the LSA that was dissolved into the alcohol, as his results were poor at best.

7:09PM	Substance (powder/sand mix) is completely dry, dumped onto sheet of paper and into glass jar w/1.5shots (approx 1.5oz) of Everclear 190prf grain alcohol.

7:14PM	Solution placed in cool dark location for LSA extraction process

11/17/99
2:48PM	Solution agitated

4:10PM	Solution agitated

11:14PM	Observations: Solution is in several layers, bottom layer consists of larger assumed heavier pieces of seed, middle layer is sediment like in nature (powder)with the top being the slightly yellowish tinged liquid.	Agitating solution

11/18/99
3:00PM	Solution agitated

11/19/99
5:46AM 	Solution agitated /observation: The clear solution above the sediment at the bottom of the jar appears to have a milky substance in it (pre agitation).

6:32PM	Begin filtration process of final LSA enriched solution

6:57PM	Solution processing complete.  It is a clear/yellowish color similar to weak lemonade.  A prior net posting stated it had a urine color to it.

6:58PM	Recording heart rate: (42bm/30s) extrapolated to 84bpm

7:00PM	Solution scent is very 'chemically' for lack of a better word.  Definitely doesn't smell the same as straight alcohol.  Not the naptha either, it is a unique smell Also, it seems to burn the nostrils if you inhale to deeply.

7:10PM	After initial strength testing I have determined the solution too powerful for direct consumption, and that it *must* be cut with something in order to drink it. I have placed approx 1/3 of the solution into the last of the OJ in the house and I am attempting to drink it now.
	
NOTE: 	From the FAQ: 'if you sip a bit and hold it in your mouth before swallowing..' this is much easier said than done.  When was the last time you held a 190prf liquid in your mouth?  It's rather difficult.  When I was 18 I had few issues drinking everclear straight, I'm older and wiser now and know better than to try that.  (I also have a Foster's beer handy to chase any aftertaste, however I will attempt to refrain from using it in order to not cloud the LSA experience)

FROMNET:From the Erowid vault on Morning Glory seed dosage levels:
	Ipomoea violacea Dosages 
	------------------------
	Light 50-100 seeds 1.5-3 grams 
	Medium 100-250 seeds 3-6 grams 
	Strong 250-400 seeds 6-10 grams *
	Heavy 400+ 10+ grams 

*(The 378 I have sitting here falls into this cat.)


7:16PM	The first 1/3 of the solution has been ingested, no effects yet.  The FAQ proports near immediate effects if the solution is swished around in the mouth for a few moments, but this is inconcievable to me.  Also, that first 1/3 of 378 seeds falls into the lower end of a medium dosage, I will wait until 7:30PM if no effects, another 1/3 will be consumed.

7:21PM	My face feels flushed and warm, checking in a mirror reveals a little extra color in my cheeks, of course this could just be the everclear. (some alcohols do this to me)

7:31PM	No noteable effects to record, however walking downstairs in order to obtain something to cut the remaining solution with I thought I saw horizontal lines accross my field of vision, it didn't last long and I considered that I may be thinking myself high.

NOTE:	Rasberry crystal light is all I can find, in a vain attempt to make it overpower the everclear, I cut the water down by 1/2.  We'll see.. :  Another note, although I've only taken 1/3 and its only been about 20 minutes, it is a bit of a letdown.  Although I didn't expect the walls to start breathing or anthing like that, I was hoping for *something*

The rasberry crystal light is masking the flavor 20times better than the OJ did, but it still isn't 'easy' to drink.

7:41PM	Finished consuming 2nd 1/3 portion of the solution, there is now approx 1/3 left waiting to be ingested.  Still no results from the inital 2/3s I have drank, which equates to roughly 252 seeds or 232ug (micrograms) of Lysergic Acid Amides which are 5-10% as potent as LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide)

7:45PM	Heartrate is: 41bp/30s extrapolated to 82bpm

7:51PM	Sadly still no effects, reports I've read suggest about 45minutes, it has been almost that long.  I will give it one last shot and ingest the last 1/3 of the solution.  The only effects I have received are a mild flushing of the cheeks, a very mild headache (almost non-existant)and slightly upset stomach.  All of the aforementioned syptoms can be accounted for based on the everclear content of the drink, and the fact that I started with a completely empty stomach.  Mixing/drinking now.

8:02PM	I went into the bathroom to turn out the light and looked in the mirror to see if I noticed anything.  I thought for a moment I saw something, a facial feature bend/distort, but I stayed there and continued to look but to no avail.  I don't feel terribly nautious, but I definitely feel as though I cannot finish the drink.  I drank about 1/2 of it so I did ingest most of what I need.

8:18PM	Still no effects, I just got done cleaning up the liquid vomit that I was unable to control.  No orange coloring, all red, so I assume the first 1/3 was retained although I think I lost the last 3rd possibly some of the 2nd.  In either case, cleaning was not fun as I have tan carpets and 2xCrystal light is not fun to clean.  I'm rather upset about this	entire experiment, both the amount of effort that went into testing and at the lack of any effects of any kind at all.  

~8:30-8:45PM
Fell asleep.  I must note that during sleep I had a very vivid dream that I was in a diner or something like that, and on acid with the full blown effects.  This dream was very likely influenced by the potion, however I cannot say how much I really ended up ingesting, since I threw up a reasonable portion of it.  If I was to 	ever attempt this again, I would have made the solution a *lot* more potent by adding much much less alcohol.  

Conclusions:
Although I cannot be certain how much I actually retained, I can be certain that some very mild effects were noticed while concious, and while unconcious slightly more powerful effects were observed.  The times where I thought I hallucinated while concious were similar to the beginnings
of an acid trip, while the unconcious trip was much like a regular acid trip however it was entirely while asleep which to mean ruins the whole point of taking the drug in the first place.

For me, I want to see wild and strange things that are not normal which I am lucid and concious, bizzare things happen in dreams without drugs anyway, so I'm not interested in those subconcious altered states.  I'm also into looking at plain things, rather than 'trippy posters' and 'acid toys'  I get off more on looking at a stick for 10 minutes before I am able to realize that's what I've been looking at. 

Will I do it again? Who knows... if I do there are certainly things I would change, and it may be worth it to see if a more refined process makes any difference.  Let me also note that I am not	refuting any of the prior postings, I am however simply posting what I did and what I went through.

To me, it was a lot of effort, for little/no effect.  My next home experiment will be to attempt to grow psclicibin (sp?) mushrooms at home.








Let me first say that I have always considered myself a psychedelic drug user.  Which means that other drugs such as cocaine, speed, downers, opiates--I consider to be in a separate category altogether. I will only use them in rare instances, and I do not feel that they hold quite the same capacity for exploring states of altered-consciouness.  And out of all these, I believed that downers held the -least- potential for inducing mind-expanding states.  Until, that is, Ambien came into my life. 

As some of you may know, Ambien is a 'mild' sleeping pill prescribed by doctors to treat insomnia.  Well, I optained from my aunt a nearly full bottle of these tic-tac sized, 10mg white tablets, after complaining I couldn't sleep at night.  (Which was true.)  I think I took one a few nights, right before I went to bed, and slept quite well.

But, one night, I decided to take the pill thirty minutes before going to bed, instead of right before, thinking I could cut out the time spent in bed waiting.                                                               

Well, first things first.  This stuff hits really quickly!  I began feeling effects in about ten to fifteen minutes--although at first I wasn't sure if it was my imagination.  In some ways, it was like the beginnings effects of DXM.  Distorted depth perception, difficulty in walking, but none of what I'd call hallucinations.  But the most marked change seemed to come in my thought processes.  There was some chaotic memories and connections being made in my mind that seemed to lend themselves towards creativity.  Strange body effects too.  For brief instances, I thought I felt someone in the room with me.  This is also a common, subtle effect.  You might start talking to yourself.

What I'm trying to say, overall, is that Ambien is not your average downer. It has many sophisticated qualities that literally displace you, and the usual thoughts that arise in response to it.  But it has become my habit to, every night take one Ambien and surf the web, read, and -especially- write.  I write quite frequently and when I'm on Ambien, it literally feels more enjoyable and I feel as though I have a teacher at my side guiding me 
along the way.  Sometimes I am disappointed with my work, only to find I love it the next morning.  At other times I may come up with a sudden idea that will change my life (and the world) and put it into writing.  And the next morning, I look at it and think, 'lets do it!'

So by far the most beneficial aspects have been with its effect on my art. It makes writing a completely new experience.  I would suggest it to anyone interested in pursuing art and desiring a new perspective or a new teacher. Don't worry she's gentle, and like all the effects of ambien: 'Subtle, yet very noticable.'

Be careful!









I have never tried acid or any other mind altering drugs apart from pot, alcohol, and 12 cold and flu tablets (not recommended), so this phenomenal experience was definitely not a flashback of an acid trip.

Several weeks ago on a Thursday afternoon before sport at school, my good friend and I decided that we should alter our state of mind ever so slightly through a complex ritual we like to call ?getting shitfaced.? I was not particularly in the mood to get stoned, as I tend to become very uneasy when I am the only one stoned in a large group, and my friend and I both do different sports, so I decided to only have one lungfull of mildly potent grass, spun with some crushed rose petals (they do nothing to change the experience in any way, my friend is just a bit strange).

We then proceeded to the yard where everyone was already lined up to go to sport.

By this time the effects were minimal, only a slight light-headed feeling, and that?s all that I was expecting, not in the slightest way able to foresee the incomprehensible psychological events which were about to take place.

Waiting outside the bus I was completely capable of participating in a ?normal? conversation with a friend who was not on any drugs. I didn?t even have any fragmented thoughts; apart from the occasional illogical thought, I was totally straight. I was later told that if I had not told them that I just smoked some pot, they would not have known.
          
                 (now this is the good bit)
I suddenly felt the urge to kneel down. It wasn?t an overpowering compulsion to get closer to the ground, rather a feeling of, ? i'll be a bit more comfortable if I kneel.?  So I did.

The way down seemed to be the turning point for the experience. The time dilation I experienced was incredible. What seemed to me an hour was only the time it took to get from a standing position to a kneel.
I studied the warm sun?s rays, which splashed onto the semi-dried grass where I knelt. It seemed to remind me of a time in my childhood that I had long forgotten, when my parents would take me to the river where we used to live. And for an instant I was once again there, filled with the same uninhibited innocent bliss that only childhood (and apparently now drugs) could evoke.

This total bliss, although indescribably pleasant, came as a shock. I had experienced an emotion similar to this before, yet on a much higher dose. I stood up, and just as mysteriously and unexpectedly as the emotion came it dissipated, leaving me pondering what had just taken place.

I made my way onto the bus and sat by the window.

I was joined by a friend, who upon sitting down next to me sparked up a meaningless conversation, in which I involved myself for awhile. However, in my current state of mind I knew I would benefit more if I just turned and looked out the window, so I told him in a very polite way that I am incredibly sorry but I must turn and look out the window now. (He thought I was joking, but after seeing that I did not turn back to him he found another victim to bore with pointless chatter.)

As I was trying to figure out what had caused my bliss just a few minutes ago, I started to take greater notice of the lush green trees outside. Then just as suddenly a wondrous feeling came over me. This was many times more profound than before and it lasted for most of the 15-minute bus ride. During this time I lost my entire internal monologue, apart from the occasional ?wow? and ?what?s going on.? My mind was empty of verbal thought, instead filled with raw emotion, a type of bliss or ?nirvana,? if you will, so profusely mind-blowing that it brought tears to my eyes.

An endless psychological orgasm is perhaps the closest verbal description I can put to it.

Every stimulus from the outside world conveyed a type of wonder and pure undivided happiness that I have never seen the likes of before.

This utopia stopped when we reached the pools, but then an hour later on the bus home I experienced the same phenomenon as before, on the same amazingly vivid scale.

And to this day I occasionally have a glimpse into this state without any drugs and find that the world seems to have much more wonder and beauty than it once had.







This is a combination of two separate experiments. One done one night before the other.  Both with the same dosage.

2 grams of Peganum harmala 
10 grams of Gymnopilus spectabilis
4 decent size roaches (marijuana)

The Peganum h. was ingested 45 minutes before the mushrooms. The mushrooms were crushed as much as possible, and then at the last minute, dropped into beef stew. The roaches were smoked one and a half hours after the mushrooms.

I began to feel the mushrooms taking effect after about an hour. The effects were mild, until the weed was smoked (marijuana always enhances entheogens for me). After that, everything became very psychedelic.
There were colors forming everywere, and the patterns could definitely be noticed. If I concentrated enough, I could put all the patterns together, to form one inmense spiral (the spiral that contains the whole universe in it).

I had more visuals on the first night. On the second night was when I broke through:

I closed my eyes and began to concentrate. All the sudden I was no longer in my body. I was not anywere on Earth. I had entered the spirit realm. It was either too dark to see anything, or I just couldn't see. I could only feel another spirit in the distance (the purpose of me going into the spirit realm, was to make contact with a loved one). I could not feel that it (the spirit) had any color to it, it was very transparant tho. As I approached it, I began to feel love. When I reached it, I merged with it. We were no longer two separate spirits, we were both one. The feeling was so intence. It was a feeling of pure love. It was the best feeling I have ever felt. Words can't ever describe how good it felt. I also noticed that I, or the other spirit I was with didn't have any thoughts. We were pure energy. There was no thoughts, it was all just a feeling of energy (love). Unfortunately this didn't last very long (not longer than thirty seconds). The next thing I knew, I was back in my body.

I was also able to reach a deeper consiousness. Before this experience, I believed that there were only three. Now I know it goes much deeper than that. In this deeper consciousness I was shown a much larger part of my mind. But I also realized that there is much more. I am not sure if this mushroom will allow me to go deeper. Perhaps a combination with Salvia will do the trick.







I went to a rave this past weekend (12/3/99) with a group of friends. Two of them were given some GHB in water and they drank alot of it. The first, being smaller is stature, about 20 minutes later was all messed up and then passed out and started flailing around on the ground in a convultion type manner for about 1-2 minutes, and then was unrousable for about 10 minutes afterwards. He then woke up and seemed to be fine, but still kinda out of it. 

The second, we found about an hour later sitting against a wall slumped over and unrousable for at least 30 minutes by the time we decided to carry him to the car and leave. He suddenly regained conciousness as we were carying him and freaked out at first and then was able to walk the rest of the way to the car. He was concious for about half of the 20 minute drive home before passing out again in the middle of a lecture from one of our female friends. 

When we finally reached our destination, thats when things got really wierd. He was still passed out and we attempted to awake him to go into the house, but all he would do is moan slightly in aknowledgment to our trying to wake him, as if we were just some dream taking place in his head. Them after about 15 minutes of that, we attempted to position him to be carried inside, but he started to push us away and fight us almost violently while moaning loudly and babbling incohearntly, but with his eyes closed the whole time. He is not a small guy and became too difficult to deal with. After trying to do this for about 15 minutes, we finally roused him enough so he snapped out of it and was able to walk inside with some assistance. 

We immediatly put him in a bed and covered him up. Once in the bed, he began to rock back and forth while laying on his side and moaning. It was as if he was having a dream that he couldn't wake up from. I had to leave shortly after that, but he obviously recovered since I haven't heard otherwise from anybody. What a crazy night! We were all so freaked out, the worst part was that nobody knew how much he had taken so we didn't know weather it would just blow over or to be really worried and take him to a hospital. Be careful with GHB, make sure you know what your getting yourself into!








I haven't read through all of these reports yet, so I don't know if anyone has had an experience quite like this.  Years back, when I was 18 years old,  myself and two of my friends decided to try Acid.  One friend had already done it before (Brian), but me and my other friend (Jason), had not. 

So, one night we took the acid and then proceeded to go out for a night on the town.  After an hour or so, Brian started to trip, yet Jason and I had not felt a thing from it.  After about 2 hours we started to question Brian's claim to be tripping, as we were still not feeling a thing.  Brian started to get really loopy and started to freak out that we weren't feeling a thing.  For some reason, the acid did nothing for us.  We figured it must have something to do with it being our first time.  The first couple of times that I smoked pot, I also felt nothing (as many of my friends also experienced).  So, not to miss out on all the fun, Jason and I decided to  drink an 8oz bottle of Robotussin DM each (as we had done many times before).  

We drank the cough syrup down in one long, agonizing gulp as per usual, threw our bottles out the window of the car and proceeded to go to my home because my parents were on vacation (and Brian was really not okay to be out in public anymore).  Shortly after arriving to my house, I started to feel very nauseated and hot, so I went up to my bedroom and lay down.  As I lay there, I became hotter and hotter, and felt that something was very, very wrong with me.  I actually had thoughts that I might die because I had done Robo a number of times before and I never got sick.  Feeling sicker and sicker, I then made my way into the bathroom and puked my guts out.  It was a very strange vomit, as there seemed to be very little, if any, fluid in the barf.  It was dry and chunky, and very gross.  I flushed the toilet, thoroughly brushed my teeth, and then as I looked in the mirror, realized that I was now feeling pretty good and rather high.  

I decided to go downstairs and see how my friends were doing.  As I began walking down the stairs, I overheard my friend Jason repeating over and over, very frantically, 'No more RoboCid, No more RoboCid...'.  Brian asked where I had gone, and I began to tell him about my feeling sick, when  Jason interrupted 'Yeah, me too, and then you got really hot, ...and then you puked....'  Very surprised he knew all this, I just answered with a simple 'Yeah'.  Then Jason exclaimed, 'Me too! And, then you saw it, didn't you?'  I replied, 'Saw what?'  And then he hit us with it... 'The Demon!' Jason shouted.  

I couldn't believe what he was telling me... he had lost his mind.  He then proceeded to explain that as he was puking a demon came from behind him and said 'Don't you ever fucking do this again'. The rest of the night was fun, but for an hour or so, I felt like I was on my way to a very painful, agonizing death.  Needless to say, after my experience, I didn't require a Demon to set me straight.  There was and will be 'No more RoboCid' for me.







It's surprising how such a small amount of a thing can effect such a profound change in a person. I just shelled out $30 for an eighth of ganja. I know it's a large price for such a small amount (4 oz is about $300 where I come from), but it was well worth it. It was my first hookup from this person (I will call him 'Steve'), and I had the usual hope/joy/fear feeling that comes from putting your trust in somebody you hardly know. Two days later, it happened, 'Steve' told me to meet him in class early; we would 'make the pass' there. A simple handshake and a smile was all it took. Now, normally, I don't like to do that stuff at school, because I believe that students that don't want to be exposed to 'drugs' at school have the right not to be (that and it's almost asking to get busted), but I made an exception that day. School flew by in a blur as I anticpated my enjoyment of the evening.

I got home at 3:00 that afternoon, and made my preperations. A glass of lemonade to stave off cottonmouth, a carrot (a very effective way to eliminate ganja breath), and 'Are You Experienced?' by Jimmy Hendrix was all I needed.

At exactly 4:20 I packed my bowl and sparked up. I took a few 'warm-up hits' (I hadn't toked up in a while) and took a few more regular hits. I then repacked and relit. 

Now, I don't know if it was something in the ganja, or if my lungs just reacted strangely, but when I was about ready to take another hit, I involuntarily inhaled VERY deeply. I was overcome instantly with a feeling of extreme disorientation and confusion. I put my bowl away and just sat there for a while. I ate my carrot and sipped the lemonade as I felt the first effects of cottonmouth coming on. I put Jimmy on and listened for a while. 

When 'The Wind Cries Mary' came on, I felt a funny feeling in my ears. You know when you have the munchies and eat something crunchy and get that really good feeling in your jaws? Well, I had that, only in my ears! It was the most amazing feeling I have had in my life so far (I'm only 16). I sat there for what seemed like hours, listening to 'The Wind Cries Mary'. I downed the last of my lemonade and grabbed a pack of gum on my way outside to see what I could see.

I sat in my back yard, chewing gum and watching the sun set. It was incredably beautiful. All the colors and shapes seemed to dance in the sky, just for me. I felt deeply awed and honored to be able to see this sunset. I sat and thought about myself and my life, and their directions. I learned some pretty deep stuff about myself that evening. For example, I found that by unintentionally acting like an asshole for most of my youth, I had hurt some people pretty badly, and had really been a major source of bad vibes. Others did not hurt me, I only hurt myself.

When I came down, I felt reborn. I wanted to put my lessons learned into use. My life was going to be better from now on, I came back to school with a new mission. I made amends with all the people I had hurt. I got some wierd looks (apoligizing to somebody for something you had done 5 years ago will do that). And started to learn, not just be there. What were once D's and F's are now A's and B's. I have turned my life around, all because of a kind green bush that the U.S. government has decided must be outlawed because the think it is bad for people. It is because they do not listen to people like me. They refuse to hear the good, only the bad.

I would like to thank Erowid for allowing me to voice my profound changes brought on by the kind bud. May we all learn greater lessons to come.






I cannot count how many times I have heard the phrase 'I tried that(referring to crack) a couple of times but I didnt like it,' or 'I tried crack and I didnt feel a thing.'  These so called 'experienced users' think they know everything a crack addict experiences by simply using the drug a few times.

The first time I tried crack I didnt feel anything.  Like many other people I thought it was highly overated and I considered it relatively harmless.  I wasnt looking to go out and  do it regulary after my first use, but I wasnt against it either.  Because, as I said, it really had no effect on me after my first use.  So I thought.......

There are stages to crack addiction.  Recognizing these stages and understanding the effect crack has on the mind during these stages is half the battle. The period of time between when I first used crack until when I became a  full-blown addict was over a 1 1/2 years.  During that span of time, I felt like many other people do right now.....'I had tried crack but it didnt do anything to me and I still didn't know what all the fuss was about.'  During that time, I had no desire to use the drug ......but on the other hand, I also had no reason not to do it.  My defenses had been lowered towards crack after I felt nothing after the first time I used.  

So was I addicted after the first time I smoked crack?  It can be argued either way but I dont believe so. There wasnt anything pulling me back to crack after I tried it for the first time. Being in the wrong places at the wrong time and hangin around with wrong people lead to the beginning of my addiction.  The second stage: User constantly thinks of crack.  Euphoria races through the mind at the slightest hint of the drug; followed by intense and constant urges which lead to more binges and more depression and inevitably a deeper addiction. 

I could go on for days talking about crack.

My goal is to help others who are suffering form crack cocaine addiction.  Feedback is greatly appreciated please feel free to email me at BIZNIS_3@yahoo.com.







As a college-educated professional, I can afford many diverse and challanging hobbies.  I love to ski, rollerblade, lift weights, play guitar, and travel.  But my most challanging hobby is smoking crack.  I moved to a new city three years ago for a great job that paid a ridiculously high salary.  I had always smoked weed recreationally and when I ran out, I needed to find a new source in a new city.  Being a danger-seeker, I went into the worst neighborhood in the city where you can buy any drug under the sun on every street corner.  I found a guy who had twenties of weed and bought three.  He also gave me two small clear bags with white rocks in them and told me it was a free sample.  I knew what crack was and what it did but I had never tried it.  

As soon as I got out of that neighborhood, I pulled out my bowl, loaded up some weed, and put one of the rocks on top.  As I took several hits, I experienced the most intense high I will ever know.  I sat in my car for the next hour sucking on that bowl like it was my best friend.  I next went to an ATM and took out $100.  I sped back to that same corner to the same guy who knew what I wanted as soon as he saw me.  I spent the next 14 hours smoking crack.  I spent the next week wishing away the days until Friday after work.  I spent that entire weekend smoking $450 worth of crack.  

I have smoked crack in every resturaunt, mall, concert, and sporting event in this city.  I have smoked crack in several other states and even took some with me on my honeymoon to Hawaii.  No one who knows me has the slightest clue that I spend at least four days a week driving into the ghetto buying crack.  I know the dealers on the corner better than I know my own co-workers.  The sad thing is that I have a great life and have everything to lose if I am caught by either the police or my wife.  And one of these two things is inevitable because I can't see myself stopping.  To anyone who is thinking of trying crack, all I can say is: don't.  While I have the money and skill to support and conceal my habit, it is only a matter of time before it catches up with me because I can't stop.











I saw the film american beauty tonight. The 'moral' made so much sense to me because of how my acid trip on the fourth of july congealed meanings and existences for me. To say that everything is 'okay' would be both understatement and would not do justice to the calm and comfort with existence that I felt. The main character exhibited these features and the plastic bag dancing in the wind showed me that I am not insane for finding mundane, inconsequential things like that gorgeous. 

I have faith vested in some overarching concept that includes humans, but I cannot say what. It is larger, but not gigantic--infinitesimal but not insignificant. I have trouble calling it a thing, because this tends to imply that there is something to be learned or understood about it. I personally feel that on some level, all humans understand it but that some tap into this understanding with more ease than others. To call it god would not do it justice, due to the social meanings applied to that word. To personify it would be fruitless, for it encompasses all of humanity, life and existence and holds within it all human experience--that which has happened, that which is happening, and that which is going to happen, all encoded in some vast fullness. 

When I had my first trip july fourth, I felt like I had tapped into this 'collective consciousness'. It was very good acid according to those whom I knew there who had experience with the substance. It was on a roof of an apartment building in the city and we were waiting for the fireworks to begin. A few hours before, I knew that I would have an opportunity to take some 'mind-expanding' substances, but I didn't know specifically what. I decided to try LSD because I knew quite a bit about its history, and that set and setting factored heavily into the experience. I felt that this setting was good even though i was in an unfamiliar place because I was with two friends whom I trust on a very fundamental level. I also wasn't taking any medications or the like at that time. There were quite a few people there that I didn't know at all, but this didn't bother me at all. I took two tabs about forty-five minutes before the fireworks started--the tabs were basically white construction paper, no patterns or designs. Fifteen minutes before the fireworks, I took one hit from a joint. I will discuss the connection to weed a bit more below. 

About five minutes into the fireworks I started to feel something and started to really get into the experience of watching the fireworks--the lines of smoke, the bursts, the classical music drifting up from somewhere below and in front of us. I remember some acquaintances calling out the element that made that particular firework that color. I remember feeling the acid hit me hard when one kid said 'oh, and that's magnesium'. The experience soon morphed into a belief that what I was experiencing was a sort of limbo from which all people's lives emanated. Limbo was sitting on a roof watching fireworks and listening to classical music. And it would just keep going until you went down to get a glass of water (one existence or life), went to the side to make out (another existence), but you would always come back to watching fireworks and listening to classical music, which was a very pleasing and unthreatening experience. 

As the trip progressed, sounds and meanings of words started to phase. They went out of sync and, due to phase cancellation their 'true' meanings and sounds were revealed. (This phenomenon is not unlike the audio equivalent of phasing--check out Steve Reich's early works with tape loops: 'It's Gonna Rain' and 'Come Out'). What I mean by 'true' is not equivalent to 'inherent', but more so what I perceived to be the truth for the portion of humans that I know. This phasing continued while I slowly leaned back and closed my eyes. Apparently I was rolling around on the roof mumbling incoherently, but I was having an amazing experience. I only harbor a little regret for not having seen any visual hallucinations, but I am not a very visual person compared to some. Still, even without visuals, this shit was tweaking/repeating/phasing audio and then progressed to tweaking existential meaning in the same way. 

What happened while I was lying down with my eyes shut, or 'under', is difficult to explain. I felt like I was connecting to all and everything--going out in all directions while simultaneously delving inward. I experienced utter ego surrender--I knew that I had a prior existence as 'me', but since I had this knowledge of the interconnectedness of all things, I felt safe, secure and comfortable in being a part of that and moving with its ebb and flow. Whether or not I came back to the reality I knew as 'me' was not an issue. I knew that my life was 'right', including all the 'bad' shit. While 'under', I understood the meanings of all the 'evil' and wrongs that exist(ed)/will exist and that they came as a package deal with existence. I understand evil's place, in a sense. It is possible that I understood that good vs. bad/evil is an extremely subjective thing, even if those definitions are accepted throughout the society.  Also, that which one finds to be bad or evil could be considered to be a comparative thing that helps one see, appreciate and enjoy what one perceives as 'good'. 

The trip was getting molecular (approx. two hours after I had taken the tabs and about an hour into the trip) and in doing so, it made me realize how the interconnectedness was also on a molecular level and emanated in all directions. This was definitely the peak of the experience, and it included utter ego surrender. There was an overarching mental image that was similar to others' description of the 'kaleidoscope' effect that somehow incorporated a profile of my head with spherical molecular structures intertwining--not unlike the type of molecular structures pictured on Erowid. My body also was incorporated into this phasing, kaleidoscopic image. I remember feeling my entire body being washed with waves of warmth and pleasure. 

The 'come down' from the peak (about two hours into the trip) was fascinating-just as something coming back into phase with something else, reality slowly phased back into itself, and I raised my upper body, saw one of the friends I had come there with who was sitting next to me, and muttered, with awe, 'whoa'. There was a slight breeze, and John Lennon's song 'imagine' that had been playing through the speakers on the roof was ending at about this time: 'and the world shall live as one...' this fragment repeated in my head and created some gorgeous textures. Repetition was a huge factor in my trip-a type of repetition that was slightly different in feel and scope with each supposed repetition, thus making for a feeling of constancy, but coupled with progression and a sort of evolution. After I came out of being 'under'--probably a little less than three hours after I started tripping--I was only a little bit disoriented, but I felt relatively 'normal', barring a sore jaw and an awareness of my tingling nervous system. I had no more hallucinatory effects from the LSD, but I couldn't sleep one bit that night. 

I now share this comfort with and understanding of all aspects of existence with the main character of 'american beauty' and I share wonderment with the character 'Ricky' in things usually found to be odd. In the movie, the man's face at the moment of his own death was one of contentment. I understood. Ricky did too. I think this may have had something to do with the ego surrender and the trust in the larger collective consciousness. 

Back to the pot. Having smoked a little weed before the acid hit me did some interesting things. For the first few times that I smoked pot afterwards (we're talking weeks after, not hours or days), I became extremely aware of my nervous system and could feel the impulses speeding along the nerves sending signals to my brain through my spinal cord. This feeling eventually subsided, but it was something I was really grateful for because it made me aware of my body. I recently had a minor flashback from smoking quite a bit of weed that involved racing christmas lights and a spherical reflective surface. These combined to produce trails that circled the room with the lights and a wonderful reflection of those same trails in the extinguished ceiling light.

If you feel uncomfortable about the idea of ego surrender, then LSD might not be for you. That's cool, because William S. Burroughs himself said that drugs are a means to different levels of consciousness, but they shouldn't be solely depended upon, because they aren't the only means to attain mind expansion. Personally, I probably won't do acid again for quite a while, because I feel like I learned so much and can learn so much more from this trip that I'm going to need a bit more time to sort everything out. The most central thing I learned to be true for me was that all people experience some sort of hope, comfort, or contentment during their life, even for a millisecond. And in that millisecond, according to my trip, there is a complete lifetime.







I've done E several times, and have experienced several diffrent effects ranging from the 'post coidal bliss' feeling to 'I can take over the world' feeling. My most joyus time however was second roll. and my only time rolling with friends. My buds and I slowly toked a beautifully colored glass bong at the home of a freind. Various people were crowded around the bar in the basement. The bong was on fire, and we happily talked as we exchanged hits. Thats when it hit me. The pill I had taken an hour earlier finally began to kick in. 

A note to consider, I am not the most talkative member of my group of friends, meaning I'm not the class clown or the joker member of the group which is always conversing and socialzing. I mostly just like to chill and enjoy their company. However, as the effects of the pill became apparent, I enetered a whole new world with these people I'd never experienced. Suddenly, I was the center of attention. I sat in the middle and began talking, began taking charge. Listening to every word with heart and undivided attention I quickly recived the attention of the whole household. Talking louder, I spoke with more confidence and emotion in my words and facial expressions than I had ever before all awhile being and feeling totally sincere. Everything that came out of my mouth was funny, smart, or inspirational. The awkwardness was gone. 

I started up funny and friendly conversations with people I barely knew, and would not have even talked to normally. I joked casually with girls I would have never had the confidence to even make eye contact with in the past I had turned from the quiet reserved Brian to the sociable, confident Brian I had always dreamed of being. I had a feeling of confidence I had never experienced. I felt like a million bucks. I took charge of the room, got the group talking, and planned a day of fun for us all, We went to the stadium and watched a game, all along, with me talking and telling it how it was. It was the most pleasurable day of my life. All the things I had worried about asking, and all the people who had intimidated me in the past were no more. Everyone was my friend. My fellow brothers and sisters. The awkwardness and fears conversing were gone. No more was I held back by low self-esteem. I was flying high, saying what was on my mind, holding nothing back. It was after a few hours of this bliss  I began to notice the drug starting to wear off. 

I felt a little depressed as the effects slowly diminished. I was losing the feeling of confidence and love I had felt just hours earlier. I slowly began to withdraw from the group socially, and by the end of the night I was sitting on the couch again in which I had sat earlier that day before the pill. Back to my shy, normal self. My friends could see it too. The funny fast talking leader I had been had faded. I was once again a listener, not a leader, as I chuckled at my friends jokes, trying to hide the fact that I was slowly slipping back to the drab normality. This drug is truely intense. 

It makes me wonder... What if we could feel this way all the time? Imagine the love, the freindship, the things we would get done. The confidence you feel with this drug is crazy. It literally makes you feel as if you had just won 10 million dollars. That warm funny feeling of happiness you get in your stomach when your getting married, going to pick up your new car, and the jittery anticipation you get when trying to sleep on Chritmas eve.. I have seen the light with this drug, and have thus posed the question: 'If it is possible to have these feelings, and feel these riviting emotions, why must we as humans rely on a pill for this. If we could feel this way, why do we feel normal, Why instead of feeling simply normal, can't we feel this great? Why do we have to experience the depression and pitfalls of our minds, if it is possible to feel this much more free. Imagine if everyone felt like they were rolling. Imagine all the worlds people with those kind of boosted feelings. Everyone happy, everyone confident, everyone loving. Imagine. It is possible, it is real. It's the mixing of chemicals in our brains. And because of this, I hope someday medical science finds a way to induce this feeling without causeing harm to the body. And when it is found, we, the people, will take this world to heights never before imagined. For you see, when your on 'E' anything is possible.










Ok, i have determined to somehow get this off my chest, because everytime i try to verbally explain it, i feel as though i cannot relate how i feel in an effective way. This experience was, to me, so ground-shaking and awe inspiring that i am shaking even as i sit down to write about this.

And i should say, that it is a very, very extended story, so feel free to get a drink, and get ready to burn up. I assure you, everything i say is as true, and accurate as i can recall, it is, i think, beneficial and therapuetic for me to put this down, to be able to let it go. So here goes...

Alright, in the month of September of last year (1998), we had picked up this acid.  So we all dosed, (there were 5 of us)and continued our ritualistic 'get together-to-trip' biweekly/triweekly thing.  But what we did not know, is that this acid was very, very different from what we have ever dosed before.

Everyone all agreed the day after, (under which, the effects STILL lingered) that this acid was definately different from what we have ever tried before. I remember sitting in my livingroom with my buddies, looking over to two of my friends sitting on another couch, and they slowly turned into a one-point perspective black-and-white pencil drawing. I also remember walking into my kitchen and seeing my cat lie on the table facing away from me, he turned his head around (like an owl does) and meowed at me, i remember standing there for at least 20 to 25 minutes just thinking about things like; 'what happened to him as a kitten that would make him meow at me that exact way at that exact time' you know, just over-analyzing the entire microcosmic situation. But the thing that really got me, was that i was sitting in an upright position on my couch, just listening to the entire conversation, and not speaking, and all of the sudden, the entire range of my vision started to receed, to the point where it looked as though i was looking at the world through two holes that seemed to get smaller the farther i got got away from them, and bef!
ore i knew it, those to holes became attached to two tunnels, which dropped down, like a submarine telescope.

It then went black, and i was sitting in a metal chair in a vast, black and empty room, for some odd reason, i knew it was round, and somehow i also knew it was big. i was siiting in this chair with armrests on it, and at the bottom of the chair, there was a poll attached to it, this thin pole extended farther and farther down until it dissapeared in the dark of this room, so it felt as though i was sitting in this suspended chair directly in the middle of this vast, empty room.

I remember trying to figure out what exactly was going on here when something totally weird and unexpected happened. I started to become aware, with all 5 senses, of the entire environment that my body was in, simultaneously with the 5 senses i was experiencing within this room on this chair.

I remember that after the trip, i asked my friends if i had blacked out at all throughout the entire trip, and they said no, that i was 'just sitting there, staring at them'.  Needless to say, i tried desperately to crawl back to my 'normal' state of mind, and grasp for some sort of security to ground myself, i was unsuccessful in doing this, so i just toughed it out, although suicide was a common thought that night, for i feared that i would remain in this state forever.

*End of Introduction*

So, since then, i have felt as though there are two 'parts' to me, constantly at war. Of the 5 friends i have been with, only one is still around, whom i had known the longest, and is a true brother of mine (i should also include that that night when we tripped, he told me that everything had a red tint to it, and at some point that night we visited a nearby lake, where he, at 5 in the morning, in September, stripped to his boxers and swam in the lake, for which i found out later was 'because the lake was the only thing that wasn't red, and i just had to be in it') He halfway understands what happened that night. But the ripples of the effects of the acid left me with so much confusion and awareness, that i began to change radically. 

So the trip was over, and life goes on, with the complication of having a new awareness, i set out to continue my plans and goals for my future.
Unfortunately, it was'nt that easy. Smoking weed was a very highly regarded pasttime for me, i loved the herb, and it loved me, but after that trip, every single time i got high, i felt half like i did on the acid, but halfway different. I would smoke exactly one hit from a pipe, and feel exactly how i would feel if i had smoked a nic with a bong, no shit! i would get extremely high, extremely easily, and i did'nt understand it. i would come close to having a fallout every single time i hit just one time.

For those who don't know what i mean by fallout; i mean that i would experience the symptoms of an O.B.E.(out of body experience) My vision, better, my perception would shake left to right, with the speed increasing, as if the shaking were building enough momentum for a certain part of me to just take flight and exit.

I would come to new and different realizations about everything and everyone around me, even the entire universe, the possibilities of my awareness seemed so unlimited, yet i was completely terrified of it. It was as though i had stripped down all the viels of my conditioning, and i was completely honest with myself about everything i percieved, so i recieved a whole and infinite understanding of everything. As if i was an infant, or prehistoric man. impulses to do things also became stronger, i became jumpy and unpredictable, even to myself.

So i quit smoking for SIX months! and i was completely sober, and all was well. But one night, as i was sitting on this very computer, the 'sickness' crept upon me, and my vision blurred whenever i turned my head or shifted my eyes, i started to get that feeling in my groin that you get when you trip, and my thoughts, along with my heart, were racing faster than i could keep up. 

I figured it would go away

It didn't.

For the next three days i experienced this, i could'nt drive, work, or do anything. I became increasingly afraid that something was seriously wrong with me i.e.: a tumor, etc.  So i made an appointment at the doctor's office. I went in, and i explained everything to him ( i might have left out the fact that when i had this 'sober-trip' that my left pupil was dialated, while the right was normal at all times)

He said that he was unsure about what was going on, we discussed the possibility of a flashback that turned into a permatrip(after the tumor was ruled out) and that it was possible with some people to experience 'hypersensitivity' whenever something s that causes shock occurs. Hypersensitivity meaning that all senses are improved.
He determined that that's what it was, and i just needed something to slow my mind down, and help with stress, i asked about the fact that marijuana usually does that for me, but he then told me that sometimes you build a tolerance to specific parts of the drug, and specific parts of the drug have their tolerences broken down. Kind of like cofee, or cigaretts.
So basically, what it came down to, and this is just my rendition of the phrase, but i sincerely feel that i have pried open my third eye, and i can never close it again.

The drug, that i took for 2 weeks, and then returned to normal, helped me to realize that i have two levels unto which i can percieve the world, one consists of the situation at hand, and the other pertains to the infinity that is always around us, and within us. I have been happy to stick with the first, because the latter is competely horrifying to me, but sometimes, that other side, which i have come to referr to as 'the sickness' creeps up and takes a hold of me, unto which i have designed many specific meditation techniques that have worked for me when i needed to get out of the hole my mind was digging.

I am trying as hard as i can to decide if this is a gift or a curse. And i have also tried as hard as i could to try to diminish the fear, so one day, i can utilize this tool.

Anyhow, i feel like this is a good ending, but i still feel as though i have'nt even scratched the surface of this, i'm sorry, but i am tired, and, ironically, i feel the 'sickness' creeping up on me again, i must sleep, thank you, and goodnight.







Well, I don't pretend to be any kind of drug Guru, there is a lot of shit that I haven't tried, and there is a lot that I refuse to try. But this, my friends, at 63 cents a dose, is what everyone should attempt, at least once.

When it comes to 'legal highs,' I usually turn my back and promptly focus my attention on something else that is more deserving of my time. Usually illegal drugs. Because to be at all effective, it can't have the name 'legal' attached to it. This past weekend I had a ticket to a rave, and absolutely no cash. I had recently stumbled on readings on the net about nutmeg and its effects, this grabbed my attention and seemingly warranted a try.

I picked up my friend and headed to McDonalds for a chocolate milkshake, in which to mix my nutmug (not a good thing to put it in, I'm still looking for an appropriate mode of ingestion). I put in about 18 grams (I just ground them a few hours earlier, they were quite oily, a good sign from what I've read) and headed off to the rave at about 9pm Saturday night, the party started at 10.  The party was really good, and by 11pm I started to feel the effects. It started off feeling like an alcohol buzz, mixed with a caffeine rush. This was all good, but I read that the effects don't peak for 9-12 hours, so I thought that I would smoke a bowl or two to calm down a little.  The weed had no effect, my energy was at about 8 to 8.5 and stayed that way until about 1am, when I leveled out and was just having a real good E feeling, very happy to be there and energetic, all around good vibes.

At about 2 am, things started to get a little weird. I have been a participant in the recreational drug scene the past few years.  Although I have taken my fair share of mind altering substances, I have never been on what I would classify as a trip.  I've sat there and watched my freinds trip, and talk about what they are seeing, when I've injested just as much (blank) as they have, and felt nothing even close to what they were experiencing. This always pissed me off; just once I would like to get messed and see shit, and feel the ground slide under my feet. Anyway, it's about 2am and things are getting wierd, I still have the nice E feel, with the energy, but now I'm getting an acid spin on things (anyone who has done acid will know the spin that I'm talking about). People that are on the dance floor all around me start to disappear, and the only thing that means anything to me, at that point, is the space right around me in my little dance area.  My dancing is also getting very different than my usual high energy version. It is slowing down and becoming very, very fluid. The music also is becoming somewhat flat, and sounding far away, the lights as well are not as vivid as they were earlier. This was kind of pissing me off, because this was not the way that I wanted my reality to be altered.  Then I closed my eyes.

That is when the night really started for me.  I closed my eyes, and somehow it seemed by eliminating that sense, my brain devoted all that energy to all the others.  The music came alive, the sounds were like nothing I've heard before. The high notes would hit you like pins, and the bass would push you around, and every song was better than the last.  This is what I was looking for, my very first full-fleged trip.  My body was acting like it was on cruise control, I didn't have to think about dancing any longer. My hands, feet and body all did what they did, and all very smooth and fluid like.  I was free to concentrate on the music that was sounding so good. Then the visuals started.

I have never had any visual hallucinations before, besides some tracers one time when I ate too many shrooms.  The things that were going on in my head were intense.  I was dancing on the floor, with my eyes shut, in my own little area (with definite wall-like borders). My body was doing who knows what (I felt as though I was detached from it), watching a 'video' play in my head.  It was the coolest thing that I've ever seen.  It started with just random thoughts, popping in and then staying there. They started to morph into other things, then they all just started reacting with one another and forming a video. Complete random objects were transforming into other complete random objects.  There is really no way for me to decribe what the hell I saw in my head that night. I would see celery stalks that morphed into mannequin legs, that got squished into a tabletop that streched into a bus, etc, etc, etc.  These were incredibly real and vivid things, the music at the same time was interacting with the objects, and the objects seemed to reflect the feel of the music, they both fit each other perfectly. I would find myself on the dancefloor, standing in a strange pose for I don't know how long (maybe 10 seconds, maybe 15 minutes), laughing at the video. It was all so strange because it was in my head yet everything that was going on was a complete surprise.

It's about 6am now and the trip is just starting to really kick in. My mind is everywere at once examining all the visuals, and taking in all the incredible music surrounding me.  Somehow through all this I am able to keep complete balance,  in my little area.  While all these random thoughts were streaming through my head, once in a while a more 'major' thought would pass by and stick. I started thinking about how nice it would be to be sitting at home on the couch with my cat watching t.v., then I was there.  I was sitting on my couch with my cat on my lap, I could feel how soft her fur is, how much heat she can generate and how she purrs when you pet her. INTENSE. Never have I felt anything like this before, it was so real, and dream-like at the same time. I could control my actions in this dream and feel all that I would if I were really there.  I did this a couple more times, once I was making pottery, and another time I was cracking open fresh coconuts, with a machete (don't ask me).  But all these dreams were so very vivid, and when they happened everything else disappeared, all the other visuals, the music, everything.  I don't know how long they lasted for, but each time I snapped out of one, I was in some weird pose like a statue in my corner of the dance floor.

If the rave would have kept on going I would have been fine, but it shut down at about 8am.  I was the last person on the dancefloor, and everyone was crashed out all over the place.  The acid like spin on everything was still very strong 12hrs after I ingested, I had a lot of trouble functioning, and doing things like walking and packing up.  The weather outside was crap, it's december and the winds at 60km/hr and it's 25 below. Fucking cold and I can't do anything much less drive. The whole thing would have been a lot better if I lived within walking distance to the rave, but I live out of town and could not see me getting home any time soon (real shitty).  All I wanted to do was crash, and unfortunately the friends that I was with were all pissing me off.  I just really wanted to be home at the that point.  So we got to a friend's place and crashed until 3pm on Sunday, when for some reason we all had to get out.  I was still completely out of it, I felt uncooridnated and things were hard to compute. 

After a massive amount of shit (battery dead, dad had to come get us, dropped off friends, brother drove car home because I still couldn't), I got home and crashed at 4:30pm Sunday.  At 9:30pm Sunday I got up to get some water.  I could barely stand I felt so drunk, I hit the wall and wiped out trying to turn on the lights.  This is over 24hrs after ingestion. I stumbled back to bed and didn't get up till 11:30am Monday.  I was still feeling drunk, but not as bad, and spent the rest of the day in a fog till about 9pm that night, a full 48 hours after injestion.  

This is definitely not something that you should do if you have an afternoon to kill.  This takes planning, and I would do it someplace that you feel safe in and could stay for a couple of days.  Work the next day would be impossible, don't expect to be able to do that for a good 2 days.  Although I have never had a bad trip off of any drug (only positive experiences, knock on wood!), I could see this turning out bad because of the intensity of it. Some people who may not be able to fully let go and receive the experiance would have a bad time fighting with it. You really have to let go and go where it wants to take you. I would fully recommend this to anyone, but be careful if you have any nut allergies, that may be the reason why some people get so sick on it.  I've read that people may be nauseous for hours, but that might be because they took it all at once in one mouthful. A slower mode of ingestion worked better for me, though I would like to find a better medium than a milkshake, maybe a strong flavored slurpy. Any-hoo, this is definitely a thumbs up experience, although it definitely won't be one that I will try again too soon (the length of it, is such a factor). But what other substance will do that for me for so long for 63 cents? It will be somthing that I will put away for special occations.







This was the first experience that either my friend or I had had with salvia, and we had his housemate check up on us every 30 minutes or so to see that we were ok.

We tried to smoke up at about 9:45, but we had some difficulty, mine came from general inexperience with a bong. (I'm used to joints, sorry) After getting maybe 2 solid hits, and my friend getting maybe 4 or 5, we lay back and waited for the effects. All we felt was a mild pulsing at the top of the forehead, and for me, at the bottom of my chin, as well as a very warm feeling. After about 30 minutes of waiting, we decided we'd missed our window, so we decided to try again in a hour. We sipped some white wine, and smoked a tiny bowl of weed, perhaps about 3 hits a piece, then we tried the salvia again. 

This time, the effects came and no mistake. I took about 6 hits, and then I lay back on the ground, I don't remember waiting for the effects to kick in. By the time I got the fourth one in, I was feeling it. It reminded me of the first part of an acid trip - millions of thoughts at once, they all tail off as if someone was holding them at one end, and burning them at the other. You have no sense of time, the sheer volume of thought, the recursiveness of the thoughts - by that I mean the repeating, connecting quality of them - totally shut you off from time. 

I tried to describe what I saw, but got nowhere. Then I couldn't remember if I had even tried to describe it to my friend, I sat up, or did I? I asked if I sat up, or did I? I had no idea then, or now, how many times, the next morning my friend said it was at least once.

He was not getting as high as I was, so he loaded the bong up again with salvia, and started taking hits, one so big it made him puke. While he cleaned that up, (and retched some more) I think I got a couple more hits out. So all in all, I think I had eight hits of salvia,  maybe 5 or 6 hits of pot, and about a glass and a half of white wine. 

An hour seemed to take forever, and the effects only wear off very subtly and gradually. After another hour and the most intense effects had seemed to have subsided, we ate and talked for awhile, and conversation was not impossible, a bit difficult, but enjoyable. In the last two hours I was very into drawing and writing, free association is SUPER-easy on salvia. We went to sleep at about 1, and I was still feeling the halved-chopped memory effect. One crazy thing about this stuff is that it let me seek sleep much easier than acid. I think that has a lot to do with the hypnogogic quality of the closed-eye imagery. 

Due to the pure knock-out effects- by that I mean, time investment- weed or booze lets you drive quicker- I can't see doing this every day, and I think the deep qualities of salvia are probably something you get after more experience with it. This first time was just overwhelming and to be honest, I really wasn't looking for some huge metaphysical experience. I got pretty much what I wanted. Its different from acid (imo) in that its much milder as far as being in control. I wouldn't want to do acid more than a couple of times a month, maybe, but this, I could see maybe doing once a week. Acid seems to let you shove stuff to the left of your mind, to demand of your brain to stop thinking about something for a WHILE. It may pop up again tho?now, with salvia, you'll probably not remember too much about what you were thinking a minute ago, and if you think about anything too long, ie; 5 seconds, it'll just splinter and fracture into several other, related thoughts, which further fragment. 

What did I learn? Hmm, its a cliche of quantum theorists and the like that time is an illusion, but this stuff will definitely cure you of the idea that its a cliche. You seem to experience everything 4 times as much. Music gets an endless sort of remix quality, and the difference between memory of occurances and memory of thought is all but disintegrated. About music- you may wish to pick something that doesn't have a lot of changes, or dynamic shifts. lovesliescrushing fit nicely, enough changes to make incredible facets, but no so many that it overwhelms you-which another, much different record (i forget the title, but it was some sort of psychpop that had too many changes and textures) did. dub music is also highly recommended, we had some Adrian Sherwood thing on and it was perfect.








In the Autumn of '97, I arrived at university.  The previous year had been very traumatic for me.  I had been through a very messy break up, was told by my doctor that I may never play sport again at anything approaching a decent level, and to top it all off, I was flirting with alchoholism, having been sacked from my part time job in a local shopping mall for arriving drunk.
   
And so it was with gratitude that I took this opportunity for a new start away from all these hassles, and moved in with some wonderful people who made me feel at home straight away, though I was still drinking nearly a bottle of vodka a day, unable to completely leave everything behind.
  
Two or three weeks into term, one of my flatmates turned up with a bag of ecstacy. An old hand at such matters, he asked me if I had ever indulged.  'No' I replied, but if your'e offering?  OK, he said, adopting a more serious tone, 'as long as your not drunk'. Luckily, I had been working that night, and, keen not repeat the mistakes of the past I had managed to stay sober.  So, despite my calm exterior, it was with some trepidation that I gulped it down, along with my flatmate, his girlfriend and her best friend.
    
I spent most of the next twenty minutes, running around like a headless chicken, making cups of tea, and tidying my room, despite the others insistence that I should sit myself down and have a spliff.  My flatmates girlfriend put some deep, expansive house music on and I started to skin up, grateful for something to do. A couple of minutes later the joint was complete, and I looked up to see three beaming faces, all looking at me.  I took this as I sign that they had all started to feel the rushes, about the standard 30 minutes after taking the tablets, but was concerned that I was still yet to feel anything myself.  Don't worry, was the general consensus in the room, they're really good pills, it will happen soon.
    
Sure enough, as soon as the joint was lit, I felt an explosion of pleasure, emanating in the pit of my stomach, as wave after wave of pure ecstacy shot through my body.  I was aware of the corners of my mouth turning up as I took deep breaths, loving the rushes but unwilling, or unable to completely let go.  My flatmate turned to me and asked me if I was cool, he had noticed I was coming up although I had been very quiet.  Yes I was cool I thought to myself, 'EVERYTHING is cool' I replied, he smiled and hugged me tight, we were joined in the middle of the room by the two girls and stood there, transfering rushes of energy between each other.  An hour after my first tablet, I was well and truly sold.  We had moved to the back garden as it was a very mild evening for early October, and it was decided that we should take another one.  I sat in the tree at the bottom of the garden, which affords a beautiful view of the river estuary, and felt very connected with it all in a way that I have since only experienced with hallucinogens, which as it turns out, were next on the menu.
    
My flatmate walked to the shop with his girlfriend to fetch skins and cigarettes, leaving me at home with this other girl, whom I was meeting for the first time.  It was soon evident that there was no need for meaningless small talk. As most of you are probably aware, you get to know people very quickly when you take drugs of any kind with them, but this seemed to be such a special bond that it was almost with disappointment that I heard the key turn in the lock, and the two happy travellers bounded back into the room.  
   
It turned out they they had made a detour to pick up some 2c-b, which I had never even heard of, let alone taken. However, I was in an adventurous mood, and, as they were so small we all decided we would take two each, as recommended, just as we had stopped peaking on the ecstacy.  
   
It was late, and we lived in a relatively unpopulated area, so we decide it was safe to go to some local common land for a walk, which was where the trip really came into its element.  The grass was all surrounded by a shimmering green light, and the moon and stars were simply awe-inspiring, as was the depth and breadth of vision.  In the space of one evening the world had become a place of wonder and interest again, the problems of the past were in perspective and the future was looking rosy.  The four of us sat on the brow of a hill, from which you can see most of the town, as the sun came up and people started their day.  I was astonished to note how much like toy town this all looked, unreal if not exactly unfriendly.  The clouds formed animals of all shapes and sizes as we all sat in awe, feeling the last of the ecstacy leave our systems, smoking grass, and reflecting on a truly life changing experience for me at least.
    
Two years on and this trip still has the same resonance as it did that morning.  I now drink once a week or not at all, and have a healthy relationship with all drugs.  That night, ecstacy released me from the past and 2c-b allowed me to look at the future with less jaundiced eyes.  The girl I met for the first time that night is now my girlfriend of some two years standing.  The fact that this wonderful drug is so demonised in the eyes of the general public is disgraceful and I cannot praise highly enough the work that is being done here and by others who have been able to share such an experience.







I opened the large bag and took out what I eyed out to be about five grams of P. cubensis. One of the caps was rather large -much larger than a $0.50 piece. I put them in a smaller bag and saved them for later.

I now eyed up about 700 mg of Ketamine. I ingested about 300 mg and about 3 grams of the mushrooms. 30 minutes passed, and I ingested the rest of the mushrooms (2 more grams). About five minutes later, I saw a small oval light, about the size of a quarter. I was about five or six feet in the air. It made its way down to level ground, and I was transformed into a world of kaleidoscopic colors and patterns.

I began to look out into the distance and saw what appeared to be a face. At first it was only an eye. Then a nose and a moth, and finally the other eye. It was trying to tell me something, but I couldn't tell what. It's expression was difficult to distinguish. At first it looked happy, but then it was just a face. I could tell that considerable effort was put just to make itself visible.

I leaned back down and realized my eyes were not open. I could see very clearly, more clearly than I ever could, all the different shapes and colors. I was inside my brain -or at least I thought. I could tell the difference from all the various chemicals and enzymes excreting from all the different glands. Each chemical would induce a different thought or feeling to the receptor that it would come in contact with.

Everything was so clear. I could see and feel each of the endless colors. What I could see were no longer patterns, but they were structures. I could see and feel all the way around and inside them; all of them at the same time. I was one with everything. And everything was one with me. I opened my eyes, and I was outside and inside of the actual building was in. I was part of the wall and part of the people. I was part of time and part of space. I was time and I was space. I was all there was, and all there would ever will be. One would say I was a god. Hell, I'll say it myself: 'I am God'.

At this point, I began to take control of what was mine, the Universe. I made some things happen, and I changed some things from happening. Then I just sat back and enjoyed my new Universe. Quite sometime later -I have no idea how long- I began to come down. I ate 200 mg more ketamine, and insulflated another 200 mg. Within minutes, I was back. The second time was not quite as high as the first, but very close. It was probably because the mushrooms were beginning to lose their effect.

This was the best experience I have ever had. I see no way as to how it could be better. I went on -and not sure I came down yet- the biggest ego trip ever. On LSD I had been part of God, and I had all the knowledge there ever was. But this time I was God, and I created all the knowledge was mine. Other mushroom trips had not even come close.

The ketamine had a very powerful effect. It had a dramatic decrease in the time it took for the journey to begin. This was the best experience I ever had -on anything. My theory is that a psychedelic drug uses so much of its energy to take you out of your body, and then uses it's remaining energy to show you what you need. But if you take a dissociative -please make yourself aware of dissociatives and brain damage-, the dissociative takes you out of your body first, so the other drugs can use all of it's energy to teach you. I didn't think this up from just this experience. But I have experimented with a few other different plants.







My previous attempts at having an experience on Salvia were a bust so I decided I wouldn't quit smoking till something happened. I sat down with my shitty homemade bong in my room. Its bowl is an actual tobacco pipe so it holds a little more than a 'bowl.'  I think I had polished off two bowls when I realized something was happening. I looked around my room to see if anything looked different.  Everything seemed the same but when I looked all the way to my left, my head froze in place and suddenly my whole body grew tense. I started to freak out a little at not being able to move but quickly reminded myself that it was just the drug and I should just let it ride.

I closed my eyes and quit stuggling. That's when I realized that the tension of my whole body was just because I was turning into a tree (an oak tree!). The bark crept up my neck and my arms turned into branches. I could hear myself growing and creaking under the strain.  I soon realized that I, as a tree, was in a forest beside a small brook. It must have been fall because most of the other trees' leaves were covering the ground.  The thing about this forest was that I actually didn't 'see' it, it was more like a picture in my imagination that remained for the time I was under. Still, I knew it was a drug-induced visual. 

Being a tree taught me how to live. It's really hard to explain it beyond that, but it was truly a mystical experience. I had a similar lesson with acid but Salvia was much more gentle and earthly. I'm not sure how long I was a tree. It felt like only a few minutes but I'm sure it could have been much longer. I felt really good about the experience afterwards and I plan on doing it again.









Well, the trip started out beautifully.  I had taken the X a couple hours before I dropped the acid.  I was looking for a beautiful, heavenly experience.  A pure enlightnening peaceful exploration of my consciousness.  And it started out fine.  I found myself in the most beautiful trance, thinking about the future of mankind, seeing a visual map of man-made creations that are yet to come.  A map of the future.  I thought, this is what we are supposed to be'.  This is the future of mankind, beautiful colors, powerful machines, and sooo much love.  And then..

My friend A came over to me, looked me in the eyes and said 'Are you okay?'  I thought.. 'Am I okay?'  then my whole world shook.  'What if I'm not okay?'  I thought..  I could sense a strong strong netted vibe that suspended between the 4 of us.  I could feel the feelings of everyone in the room, and it became clear to me that each one of us was responsible for the experience of the other.

I saw something dark.  I thought, 'I can't be around these guys if I start having bad thoughts.. They must stay happy!'  So, I raced into the bathroom as the darkness began to take over my thoughts... I could no longer see what was in front of me, I was so engulfed in my thoughts.. The pure unadulterated fear that something bad is going to happen.  

After 3 or 4 minutes of searching for the light switch, I came out, decided that in order to save the other 3 voyagers, I have to get out and get my head straight.  So I ran out the apartment.

This voyage became the scariest thing I've ever experienced.  My mind was functioning on 2 levels, pure fear, and a voice inside my head rationalizing and trying to figure out what was going on.  Suddenly anything and everything became ugly, scary, terrifying.  The gutter, the trashbags, the road workers, the oil on the street... it all disgusted me, and I had nowhere to turn. the earth's evilness was swallowing me whole.  I pissed my pants.

About this time, the other three emerge from the complex to see me darting around in fear, sock-footed, in the middle of the parking lot.  I see them, think that they're part of a cult and that I've got to get away from them.  They grab me, and a violent struggle commences.  My friends become demons dragging me into a horrible place I do not want to be.  The trip gets worse.  I begin to think that the more I struggle to be free, the better chance I have of getting in to heaven.  And then I give in for a few moments, get a glimpse of the terror of hell, and begin struggling for a positive eternity again.  They carry me into the apartment, and visions I conjured up at an early age begin appearing.  I cannot describe the fear.  They take me, and put me in the shower to hose me off (bad idea)... I see myself in the mirror, and it is covered in blood..  I see the toilet, I am disgusted to the point of puking..  I let out multiple grunts and horrible yelps.  I am being tortured in hell.  

Then my first glimpse of eternity arrives.  I realize, I am here in Hell forever.  This will go on forever.  For one last instant, I give in, and submit to the demons... I see the devil, only... it looks like me.. and I can see the pure evil inside..  I let out a bloodcurdling scream, and the others in the room realize that I am experiencing something truly horrible.  Now I've got them.  I have conveyed my terror.  I am horseshit.. rejected by God.. He's so far away from me now.. 

I walk alone into the other room... the others try to stop me, but I let them know that I need to be alone.  I lie down.  I look at the wall.  'Oh my God.. I'm tripping.'

And the true sadness and realization starts.  One of my friends comes in and asks 'Are you okay?'  I look at him and say 'I've seen the devil.  I didn't want to... but I saw him..'  He comes, lays his head on my stomach, and I realize that everything is alright.  But it won't be over for a looong time.  

I have this trip embedded in my mind, and it will take years for me to forget.  It has sent me into a horrible depression that I am currently fighting.  I suffer horrible mental problems because of my experience.  My mind is stuck on seeing the bad in life.  I think about the positive, and the complete opposite arises.  If anyone else has had an experience even remotely close to this, please submit it here, and describe how you have dealt with it.

I have quit all drugs... I cannot take them without them sending me off my rocker.  Why did this experience take place?  I often think I'm just a sick person.. but others tell me that it could have happened to anyone.  who knows.. I need a witness.








After a year of binging and crashing, it took a good sober look at myself in the mirror for me to realize I had a problem.  My friends and I were waiting for more. After an entire weekend of being 'up' I'd finally gotten about 4 hours of unrestful sleep, hadn't eaten in three days and was anxious just knowing it was on it's way. I started to get the usual nose twitches.  Then my sinuses released and I wiped my nose.  I expected for it to be clear like all the other times, but it wasn't.  I had a handful of blood.  I ran to the bathroom to clean up and that's when I saw her.  

In the mirror was a girl who looked a little familiar and so sad.  It was me I saw there, the me that NEEDED to be seen.  My hair was dirty, oily, because I'd neglected showering to get high, to stay high.  My teeth were yellow and covered with nicotine stains and plaque.  I had gone from a healthy 105 pounds to around 85, and I almost looked like a cancer patient.  Now I had blood running out of my nose into my mouth.  18 years old.  The prime time of life.  I don't know why I woke up then, why it had to take something so horrifying for me to realize that I was killing myself.  I called my mom and asked her if I could come home.  She told me she'd be there in 30 minutes.  She arrived in 20, and helped me pack my bags.  

THAT was the first day of the end and the 1st day of a beginning.  I also received the best feeling in the world...a feeling of pure and true peace, love and security, for the first time in a year, I KNEW I was gonna be okay.  It wasn't easy, but here I am, a mother of two beautiful children and a life I wouldn't trade for anything.  On the flip side of that, even though I wish I had never experienced what I did, it made me smarter, so much more aware of what is out there.  I'm afraid for my kids, but with the honesty we share they will know, how close their own mom was to dying, and I pray that what I went through was not at all for me, but for my babies.  This is part of a poem I wrote in the days of the parties and chaos, and I still keep it to remind me where I have promised myself I will never be again.

'White-my favorite color, the only one I know.
It's the color of my walls. The color of my snow.
They say it makes you crazy. You say it makes you sane.
Yes, white's my favorite drug, and its color is cocaine.'







I took E with my friend of two years last weekend. We were prepared with candy, pacifier and all the other trinkets that the FAQ's recommend. We popped it at 7:15 and it took 45 minutes to kick in.

It hit her first. I could tell she was starting to act funny when she wouldn't stop talking about the photos of her ex girlfriend and how awesome they were and how she missed her. She also said she felt lightheaded and that there were echoes in the room. I was not experiencing any of that yet. We tape recorded the first 15 minutes of our trip which will be a conversation piece for years to come. When it hit me, the room started to seem detached from me. A sort of floating or swimming through the room. A slight dizziness set in and within the next few minutes, it felt as if I passed through a brick wall of consciousness.

I was on the floor making the most agonizing noises. I was immobilized with a haze so thick I couldn't pick myself up, nor did I want to. Suddenly, the carpet felt wonderful, every tuft of polyester ruffled through my fingers. My feet felt like they were across the room, at times I was even surprised I could move them. We either sat or waded around the room for the initial trip, simply admiring the music or the sensation of feeling the ground beneath. After a while we got ourselves together and began to do all the things we had planned. At times there was paranoia. My friend was obsessed with finding her legos for us to play with. She gave me the backrub of my life. My body  felt like it was sizzling. The lotion was cold, not cool, and the feeling of it being rubbed on my skin lingered for minutes after her hands had left me. We kneaded each other's bodies like dough and it became my fixation. 

My jaw started clenching and I had to suck on a pacifier for half the night. My friend was eating tootsie roll lollipops one after another. The taste of candy was amazing and intense. It was virtually bursting with fruit  flavor. Music was alive. Music sounded like it was coming from inside your head. I could close my eyes while lying on the floor with the bass beating through me and see the most vivid, colorful 3-d images of shapes swirling before me. We didn't talk for the most part but it felt like I was talking inside my head. Sometimes I even thought I heard her say something to me just barely intelligible only to find that she had not said a word.

I was doing things that I never would have if I were not on E. It lifted all my inhibitiions about being with this girl that I had a crush on for the last 2 years and with whom I had quietly resigned myself to friendship. I wanted to shower. Instead I found myself propped up against a wall, unable to gather the coordination to get to the bathroom. She ended up undressing me and putting me in the shower. Normally, I'm fiecely self conscious about revealing my body but when I was naked in the shower with her spraying water on me, I wanted her to look at me. I wanted her to see every part of me. The feeling of hot water pelting my body was amazing. It felt like the water was falling in slow motion. The cold tiles contrasted the sensation of the water. I didn't want to put my clothes back on after the shower. My friend put me in front of the heater to warm me up. Oddly it had turned arctic cold.

Then she wanted to shower. Not wanting to be alone, I remember watching her through the frosted strips on the shower door. I was fascinated, I was turned on, I was enraptured.

An overwhelming desire was building up. I could feel it the first time I touched her after we popped the E. I couldn't be away from her for a moment. I couldn't let her out of my sight or else anxienty set in. I remember trailing behind her everywhere she went. I remember holding her around the waist from behind as we walked from room to room. She became the object of my obsession. Everything that was her was intensified a million times. The smell of her hair, the softness of her skin, the taste of her mouth. It was amazing. Her skin, her skin! I remember so much of it. I remember rubbing her stomach while she lay next to me. Sometimes it was as though she was lying across the room from me, other times it felt like i was pulling her so close it was like I was trying to push her into me. I felt this need to touch every part of her body. Touching her felt better than her touching me. I loved the feeling of kneading her flesh. I couldn't keep my hands still.

I felt transformed into a baby. I wanted to be held and caressed. I suppose I might have looked like a baby too, with that pacifier in my mouth. I was running my hands all over her face. It's so strange how you can know someone so long, look at them day after day and never know what their face feels like. She was licking my fingers. It felt great. Just the saliva cooling on my hands felt great. I was kissing her face, her nose, her forehead. Then I was kissing her mouth. It was strange kissing someone else after so long, but it was good. Kissing was so good I can't even describe it.

We ate pop rocks on the suggestion of my frequent E-dropper, Lisa. It was vastly overrated. It was an interesting feeling, the fizzle and crackle of the candy, but it was even cooler biting into it. It sounded like your skull was breaking. We also tried eating ice, my personal favorite. She rubbed it on my back and it felt like being cut, the sharpness, the coldness, but without the pain.

I tried smoking a cigarette. I don't know why I thought it would be easier while on E, but I gagged it up, just like normal. We also loafed around on the carpet, with horsey rides and stuff. I was fascinated with fire, sort of how I thought I would be. I ran my hand over a candle flame admiring how it felt. It seems like it would have felt hotter, but it didn't.  We spent a lot of the time just comforting each other, hugging and rubbing each other's backs. Towards the end we just immobilized ourselves on the carpet and zoned out to the music. Time either stood still or flew by. I grew cold. I stared at the fire dancing around on the log. I lay on her chest and listened to her heartbeat racing around inside her. I remember saying 'Tell me what you want, I'll do anything you want.' I remember saying such things as 'I love life, I wish every day could be like this'  and wondering if I could do it again next weekend. I felt absolutely at peace, a warming happiness that I've never been able to acheive before. I felt a oneness with my surroundings, with the music, with her. Absolutely euphoric and free.

Days after the trip I'm still reeling back from the experience. Thinking about the evening, I can almost perceive those same sensations that were so heightened. I feel easier, free-er. I can't say that there haven't been drawbacks. I've also felt forgetful and anxious, sometimes paranoid. It's opened many doors between my friend and me. Our relationship before was so cold, stiff and gaurded. I think I was afraid of giving her the impression that I was attracted to her, because she was in a relationship as I was. We spent so much time building up these walls between us, these tall insurmountable walls. I think that I was especially cool to compensate for the feelings of guilt and frustration that I felt while hiding my attraction. 

I'm generally good at surpressing things but after that night, all the feelings I've had for her resurfaced and multiplied. All those walls melted away into a pillowy space. I feel bonded to her on a level that I've only felt while being in love. I feel affectionate and open. I want to hug her everytime I see her. Sometimes I just want to sit and stare at her. Thinking about what we did that night works me into a frenzy. At the same time time, it goes so much deeper than that. The kind of bond I share with her feels like one where two people get deserted on a an island for a long  long time and have to learn everything about each other and survive together and then are finally returned to civilization. It feels like we've been on a long vacation together. I feel safe with her, warm.  I feel like I can tell her anything and I feel like she knows everything about me without my having to say a word.

In terms of the other aspects of life, I feel liberated. More at ease with myself. I feel like I've been someplace not many other people have been and that I'm a better person for it. I feel lighter than I used to. More confident. To be honest, it all sounds great, but it also makes real life feel boring compared to the euphoria E produced. I'm sure that part will pass with time and as life gets more interesting and meaningful, but the bond built between us feels lasting. Sometimes when I think about her I get so happy I don't think my heart can contain it and sure enough when I stop to feel it, it's racing and pounding inside my chest.

Now that's happiness. :)







Well, me and my friends are all artist, wether it be musical, or visual (I personally am a Digital and Traditional artist) - we do alot of 'drugs' together for the experience and such... we often do acid and marijuana, but this time, one of us (well call him *C*) had gotten the idea to try something called 'DXM'.  *T* and I had never heard of 'DXM', so *T* and I agreed to go over to *C*'s house and try this new drug.  When we asked to see the substance, he exclaimed that he hadn't bought it yet, and that we had to go to the dealer's place.  (DOH)

Me and *T* were getting mad at *C* for not having it, untill *C* told *T* and I to jump in his car, we soon arrived at our local K-Mart and we jumped out to go inside (me and *T* assumed we were buying snacks for the trip).  When we went down the antibiotics isle, *C* held up a bottle of Robatussin and pointed to the active ingredient (Ane one of the ONLY ones..) and *T* and I laughed furiously of course. :)  

Well we got back to *C*'s house and we poured our 'DXM' (hehe) bottles into a cup and we downed the horrid-tasting-cherry-flavored-childhood-nightmare-medicine.  *C* ended up vomiting about an hour later, and he said he was coming up.  *T* and I went inside and sat down to watch the Aphex Twin (Window Licker) Video - extremely funny... anyway; *T* exclaimed that his scalp itched 'like a m*th*r f*ck*r' and asked me to scratch it for him, as well as his back.  So I scratched his back and scalp to ease his already-going-bad-trip.  After I had scratched him for a while, I was watching TV and I noticed that I was itching too, I passed it off and ignored it, after a while it was completly un-ignorable.  I quickly ran into *C*'s bathroom and took off my shirt, and ran his sink as cold as the water would get, and I rubbed it all over myself, this soothed it untill I was dry again... most of the night I had bright red hands that were puffy and itchy as if I was russling through a bush of poison ivy.  Sooo... My experience with DXM was:

1)  Extreme itching all over body and scalp
2)  Dizzyness
3)  Hands enflamed, puffy, itchy, red
4)  Extreme increase in body temprature (we didn't measure our tempratures, but we were all sweating like pigs...)

DXM, some like it, some dont... I suggest doing 1 bottle of Robatussin if you *MUST* try it.  Anything more then that will drive you insane if you get the same reaction me and *T* did...  NOTE - *C* loved it and didnt get any of the side effects we did, such as the itchiness and enflamed extremeties.










I have been interested in the effects of Psychedelic Cacti for awhile.  While using Psychedelics for the last few years I feel I have learned a great deal about myself.  I had mostly used LSD as my psychedelic drug of choice, also MDMA and Mushrooms. I had no way of fathoming what I was to expect with my Cactus experience.  I read somewhere that San Pedro was a fairly good Mescaline producer and legal in the US.  I had heard amazing things about Mescaline from friends and became interested in it's uses in tribal medicine and Native-American religion.  

I decided to try and obtain some through on-line ordering.  I obtained four six inch cacti from a business located in the Netherland.  I recieved my cacti somewhere around a month later.  My first experience was on a day when I had nothing else to do, I ended up plucking ths spines and eating one whole cactus.  I ended up with minimal effects including slight mood disturbances and a kind of phantom image in my peripheral vision.  I did not leave my home for my first voyage and it ended up being something of a waste.  

About a week later I decided to try again.  I ingested two of my remaining three cacti giving one to my friend.  We watched the movie 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' waiting for the effects to become evident.  After somewhere around two or so hours I began to feel energized.  We departed from my house on a journey to no where in particular with hearts full of sunshine.  I began to notice strange designs not evident to me normally.  I was not seeing things that were not there, and not patterns such as would be common with LSD, it was more like everything was enhanced and I could only see the beauty in all things.  I could consider things from all aspects and I had a feeling like everything fit into a grand puzzle, every little thing that we did affected other things, which affected other things.  It sounds awkward when I try to put it into words, but I feel like I really grasped the nature of things, all things.  I realized that everything is made up of atoms and energies that never truly die.  Everything is in cycles always ending up at the beginning again.  

At this moment I felt like everything I have ever worried about was worth no more concern than the death of a bacterium.  I felt I could do no wrong, as my friend and I ventured up to a small pond I felt it would be perfectly natural that I could merge with the water, I felt my body could easily become a fluid to mix and mingle with every molecule of the pond.  Everything was so perfect and I felt I had true insight into the nature of the Universe.  At this point I remember thinking I did not need anything.  It was one of the only times in my life I have not desired anything at all, I was not hungry or thirsty, not discontent, not lusting for something.  
This contrasted with my LSD experiences in that I truly had to work to quiet my soul before I could concentrate on anything or attain any insight, on San Pedro I felt the world's mysteries were bathed in light and presented to me on a silver platter.  I later tried to make a concentrate paste using the boiling technique, this was effective but with a much less rounded experience.  If you are a first time user of Psychedelics and are looking for something legal to posess, try San Pedro, you will not be disappointed.  REMEMBER if you are going to try this you must know it is legal to posess the cactus but not to consume it, so don't shoot your mouth off because you think it is completely legal.  As always, be careful if you want to try this, make sure you have a buddy (sitter) to watch over you on those high-dose experiences.  HAPPY TRIPPING! ;]







 One hell of a first experience

I'm not sure how sensitive I am to LSD-25, but I must say that this is the most potent experience I've ever had in my life.  On New Year's Eve of 1999, some friends suggested we all go camping and drop.

I'll cut to the chase.  My perceptual processes were simply not ready for the rush of everything that happened, and I spent a long period of time adjusting to it all.  Part of it was the acid.  Another major part of it was being out in unfamiliar territory and not feeling so sure of myself to begin with.  Then, there were all the people yelling, the rangers, and the fireworks.  I'm talking massive overload here.  My mind's reaction was to shut down some of the sensory input by turning off different senses.  I spent a brief period of time being blind and another one being deaf.  These both shortly came back to me, however, once I was in a lower-stimulation environment.

That's when the really bizarre thing happened.  My mind was having a hard time serializing everything into one constant flow.  Effects were sometimes happening before causes.  I soon found myself pretty much trapped in my own mind, and found that my analytical thoughts were being used to process the high levels of sensory input.  My body was running on a sort of natural autopilot (I later found out that nobody thought anything was wrong with me), but I was well lost in my own head, having conversations with archetypes of my friends and watching possible futures unfold before me...different thought patterns would naturally fizzle out and such...eventually, I'd have a window where I could act again.

The process of action was very difficult for me.  If I wanted to go sit out by the fire, I had to emote it...I had to allow my 'me-ness' to drift toward the 'fire-ness.'  Reality seemed to exist in a state of freeze-frame, too, unless I kept my body moving.  Thus, in order to stay cognizant of things around me, I was constantly tapping my fingers against a surface to keep my mind in motion.

Eventually, this settled down.  My senses of taste and touch became exceedingly dull, and were for some reason instead rerouted into the tapping of my fingers against a surface.  When given an extremely sour candy that left others writing on the ground in pain, I sucked on it, noticed no flavor, and then found my right hand drumming erratically at the table for minutes later.

Sunrise came, and it was an incredible experience.  I put on one of my more serene CDs (This Mortal Coil's album titled 'Blood.'  I recommend it.) and stretched out to watch the forest dance lightly to the music and the sunrise.  I then went down by the river's edge and sculpted it in my mind.  I have never in my life seen such incredible beauty.  Sadly, since my emotions had been tied up elsewhere in my mind, and so I found myself indifferent to it.  Never before have I experienced such beauty, and been so unmoved by it.

My body held onto the LSD pretty tightly, and so I was still feeling the effects hours after everyone else had gone to bed.  Sitting there, alone, in a dark apartment, with nobody to talk to, and hearing the neighbors argue, seemed to dredge up some old childhood fears.  I curled up in a chair, squeezed my old lovvee closely, and wept for a while.  It was hours before someone got up, but when they did, it was nice to have interaction again.

Finally, it had been about 22 hours since I dosed, and I still hadn't come down.  I was developing a headache, and was getting tired of having no sense of taste or a hand compulsively interpreting different sensations.  One of my friends made a run to the store, and I had her bring me back some Dramamine.  I've used a prescription version of it (though they're pretty much identical) to treat sleep terrors in myself in the past, and have also used it to help a lover fall asleep when she had a severe migraine.  One Dramamine tablet, and fell asleep a half hour later, and never slept better.

In all, I couldn't sum the experience up as positive or negative.  It was interesting, and I'll definitely be trying it again, although it might be a long time.







I had recently had some strange experiences with Ecstacy. I am a frequent raver and I do Ecstasy often (usually 3-5 pills a night) 1 to 3 times a week. I drink pleny of water and my pills usually take 30 - 60 minutes to start working.
     
As I am lying in my bed (usually occurs 2 nights after my doses of E) I start to fall into a deep sleep, then, all of a sudden i hear a loud, WOOM WOOM WOOM WOOM, noise in my head (almost like doing nitrous). I usually am in a half awake and half asleep state (limbo) and I have no control over my brain. Its like my mind is awake, but my dream continues to occur. I have had my eyes roll back into my head and my arms go numb on some occasions. I basically have to struggle to wake up. It is very frightening. 
     
On one occasion I was lying in my bed getting ready to fall into a deep sleep when, all of a sudden, it sounded like a jet air plane crash landed in my ear. Just one loud WOOM. I guess i really didnt give it a chance to make any more noises. I jumped up very quickly and looked rapidly around my room, until I realized what had happened. I sat on my bed with my eyes wide open, thinking that I was never going to get better, just worse. Eventually I found out that its just temporary.
     
It usually occurs for five to seven days (if i have stayed clean on E during that time frame). And if I do more E, the same symptoms come right back.
     
Ive had a few friends tell me they have the same problem with waking themselves up from a dream. But none have experienced the loud, frightening sounds like I have. I wonder if I'm the only one? I dont feel that I have lost any of my memory or and motor skills while being awake. I just have no understanding of what, or why, that is happening to me and if this is temporary now, but may have long term effects!
    
My experiences have been occuring for a month now, at first I was not used to the noise and the probems waking myself up. Lately I have been somewhat been getting immune to the problem. I can now say that the problem still does persist, but I am able to deal with my problem
     
If anyone has the same problem I do please seek medical attn. After i finish this letter, I am calling my doctor and asking for advice.  Better safe than sorry!








Me and my boyfriend had decided to candyflip for our first time on new years eve, 1999. We were going drug free for awhile as our new year resolutions, and we wanted to end it all with something new. We were headed for a party a couple hours away, and when we were about halfway there, I took my first tab of acid. When I started to trip lightly, I took another tab. About 20 minutes later, we arrived at the party, expecting a long line, but got in right away. We socialized for awhile, and at this point I was beginning to feel my trip, not an unusual feeling. We then found a friend and bought two and a half pills to split between the two of us.

We went out on the gigantic dancefloor and sat down (not something usual for me to do, but there was more than enough room), the lighting was scarce and not very thrilling, but there was a big projection screen with some nice visuals. I got up and danced for awhile, then at around 6 or 7, I took my half of the first pill. It didn't take long to hit, maybe 20 minutes at the most, but that's not long for me. I wasn't feeling amazingly social yet, but something about everyone looked different somehow. People's smiles beamed into my soul, anyone who smiled in my direction was instantly connected to me. As the E got stronger in me, the lights grew these amazing rainbow halos, much more brilliant than anything I'd ever seen on just acid. After awhile, anything light colored, people's shirts, faces, etc., grew the same halos. 

The same feelings continued, along with some mild body effects of the roll, but nothing that jumped out at me. It was as if the body effects were diminished by the total feeling of love and empathy for people. But, the acid, like a normal trip, made me realize that not everyone was my friend, there were some sketchy people there, and I didn't have the same feelings for them as I would if I were just rolling. I also didn't get that sloppy, e-tarded way about me, I was well composed, but very social and loving. 

I wanted to be connected with everyone, not in that E kind of way, but in a serious kind of way, like I'd never felt before. I got more phone numbers than I ever thought possible. I felt confident and beautiful as a person, not insecure as I sometimes do while tripping, nor did I forget I existed as I sometimes do while rolling. It was the perfect mix. I'd heard some stories of people being overwhelmed while Candyflipping, and they kinda played through in my head, I couldn't imagine why. 

At about 11:30 I took my second pill. It hit right before the countdown to the new year, nothing could have been more beautiful. When the countdown was over, there was this electricity in the air that I hadn't felt at parties in years. There was love and understanding from everyone, between the party kids and the club kids, between young and old, gay and straight, between all races...you don't see enough of that anymore, and it was beautiful. The perfect setting for this new experience. I lost my boyfriend in the crowd a few minutes later, and I took this opportunity to hug everyone I could.

The love stuck with me for the rest of the night, and the comedown was the easiest I'd felt in a long time. The afterglow lasted for days after. I couldn't erase the smile from my face. I was never hit was the lows I usually get after rolling, nor the dis-attachment I usually feel after tripping. I really do think that, for the right person, this is the ultimate drug combination, and one that I am sure to do again in the future when I am ready to do drugs again. Right now, I am drug free. This experience definitely helped put some closure on my new year resolution.







Two very close friends and I drove 60 miles to attend a foam party at a seaside resort. We drank copiously - about half a dozen ?boilermakers? each. 

Resolve thus softened, a friend who met us at the party revealed that a selection of drugs was available for purchase upstairs. Briefly, we debated as to whether we would invest in a couple of lines of Charlie, or a few pills. (Acid was ruled out immediately; we all consider it a gutter drug on the basis of our experiences). We went for the pills - one each at R80 a pop (that's about $12).

Being fairly responsible adults, and aware of the side effects of any drug before chowing it, we stopped drinking booze and went on to water and energy drinks for the rest of the evening.

Well. Munching that little pill changed me from being a person who didn't enjoy rave music at all, to the friggin Energiser bunny. 

I have never felt so close to other people before - the two guys I was with are my best friends, but the addition of a little ecstasy just made me realise all the wonderful qualities they possess as if under a powerful magnifying glass. The whole setting became more intimate (there were about 40 total strangers who were also chowed up) - people were touching one another, sharing water bottles, Tiger balm and drinks. An absolutely incredible feeling of fraternity pervaded the club.

My most remarkable observation was the feeling of absolute crystal clarity of all my senses. Drunk people suddenly seemed so oafish and clumsy. As soon as a drunk person bumped against me, I could feel, without looking, that that person was pissed - realisation dawned, that as a drug, alcohol is totally worthless in comparison to ecstasy.

We walked down to a gas station in the early hours of the morning to buy some gum. The night air was wonderfully cool and soft and alive. We chatted about our intimate feelings and aspirations - such a rewarding experience. (All three of us are degreed professionals)

Needless to say, after such a revelatory experience, we placed an order for a batch of another 20 pills for the coming weekend. The second experience - in a popular rave club, and with a dose of two pills each (staggered at a three hour interval) this time - proved to be every bit as satisfying as the first trip.

My conclusion, after researching the product and its effects/side effects, is that certain elements in society - such as cops, various members of the legal and medical professions and other authority figures, is that a wonderful stimulant with apparently negligible side effects, has been demonised and shrouded in myth. This stuff should be available on demand from every cornerstore, just like cigarettes (I don't smoke) are.







We use codeine as a recreational drug fairly often, usually about three times a week.  We take it in pill form called 'Codoliprane' which cannot be found in the U.S.(considering Codeine is not over-the-counter.)  We usually take about eight pills each in the course of one night, each containing 20 mg of codeine.  We turn out the lights and line the room with candles and spend about 3 or 4 hours writing, (thats what we do) and drinking red wine.

The entire experience is so relaxing.  When mixed with alchohol, (only wine, I'm warning you) the drug becomes similar to, although less extreme than, heroin.  Induces creativity and definitely not a problematic drug of any sort for us.  We've never experienced any strange side effects, hallucinations, or physical problems.  Yum.







I ain't got no weed, or even enough to buy a 12 pack of beer, and I'm supposed to be able to party for 8 hours tonight. I guess it's time to break out the old cough syrup. This would have been my 2nd trip with the first one not being very eventful and rather unpleasant. So I figured i'd be up all night on this shit and should have an intresting night. So i drank the bottle slowly in the car on the way to a party. I actually love the taste so i rather enjoyed it except for the nasty bite of aftertaste in the back of my mouth. 

About ten minutes after i finished, i arived at a friends apartment and felt no effect for some time. The first effects i seemed to notice after about 30 minutes was simply a peculiar stoned feeling, just like the slow movement and thought process from drinking but with none of the positive effects. The slowness slowly grows stronger into a type of confusion. Like you still know whats going on, can walk and talk normal, but you are only concerened with the subject at hand, whatever is right in front of you, whoever you're talking with at the moment, and the rest of the world is nonexistant. 

Getting a little dizzy now too. Party's getting really loud too, a bit overwelhming, so i step out side and sit at the table on the patio a buddy comes out and joins me, offers me a cigar, I totaly inhale the shit hard, and suddenly i feel all the blood of every living thing in the world blast through the viens in my head like a presureized hose. And I fly up 100 feet in a blast of adrenaline. I am lost in these feelings and visualizations when i 'come too' and realize im still sitting there. Now i'm realizing I'm really starting to trip. I'm thinking 'my god what did i get myself into' as what i was experiencing then was definitely altered consiousness but was by no means fun or comfortable, and it was just begining. 

my budy then left and i sat alone in the night, for a while, just trying to get a grip. I began to grow very sad, and depressed as I started thinking about how fucked my life was and how much shit im going to have to deal with come monday morning, and really i have no way to deal with what was going on so im really screwed. I just sat there and got more depressed to the point of tears and then realized that there was no tears. No sadness at all , just numb. My god what is going on, never felt this way before. I'm so stupid why did i do this. I get up and try to walk inside, balance is starting to get fucked up. Inside lots of people, lots of noise, besides that, confusion. No real foucus on what it is -a party at a friends house with person a and person b ect. just a blind mass of noisy people. It's overwelming, i have to sit. God I hate this shit, why did i ever do this?!! 
so i sit and try to hold my self together in this malestrom of noise and confusion and depression. Suddenely a friend who's fairly plastered just grabs me up and we start dancing around the room. Then i hear the music.. Their was no music before, it just came to me like a frieght train, i have no idea what it was, but then to me it was pure joy. My friend then says she's having such a great time. suddenly I feel as i was released from a prison i fly up and around the room in an energy of happiness. I said to her 'why did i take this shit to feel bad, your so right this is what its all about im going to have a blast tonight,fuck the rest of the week this is what it all about!! Your such a good friend' she was probably extremly confused but too drunk to care so we continued to float around the room for a while. 

The next thing i remember was sitting at a table and watching people fill up baloons with you know what. So i begged for one like a child (it was just natural at the time) and telling them how much ive smoked them out before etc. and they said relax, you can have all you want. When i got a fairly big one i sat down on the floor and inhaled the whole thing and held it. Typically that won't do much for me, but this time it was much different. 

Instantly I was away from this world. On my Very own plane. It was black in color, a void a nothingness, also silence. It was a beautiful silence. Never experienced it before. Even a deaf man has some kind of constant audio input or stimulus from his own biological inner workings. this was totally gone. To continue to describe the trip i must say 'I was' or 'I saw' but really there was no 'I' i simply did not exist nor did the rest of the world, in that black void simply a flower, changing color from yellow to orange, beautiful and on fire. Just the flower and the beautiful nothingness. So much peace, beautiful peace. I dont know how long that 'experience' replaced me and the univerrse, but to me it could have been light years. 

i started hearing voices around me and realized everyone was looking at me in this room. How dare they invade my world!! I was incensed and furious at these fuckers for destroying it. then i realised that i was simply on drugs and that the whole world would be coming back soon. Now it felt just like my usual come down from nitrous, except it was taking an unusually long time. What was wrong? Its still dark, My eyes must be closed, oh shit they are open!! Oh my god I cant see! O fuck the DXM!!! I AM TRIPPING!! when I finally get some vision back everything is in fours and spinning wildly, it's not like i was actually hallucinating, just that im so fucked up i'm not getting the message corectly and my brain is putting everything together in this fucked up jummbled mess. This prety much sucks. And I am hating life for awhile until they put on some music which really sucked ass, but i couldn't stop my self from raving wildly to. 

They turned the lights off and put up a glowing green neon sign. I started to rock and move to these shity songs in the dark and the green light started forming little super snakes of light that flew around the room, faster and faster untill i lost my self in this cosmic light show. This was the only confort. I did this until i came down 3 hours later and i just felt exhausted and a little disoriented. So it was definitly intresting which is all i hoped for. I would only consider it again if I could be in a position to dance to music and a light show for hours and just lose my self. Otherwise I find it a prety shitty drug and definitly not a substitute for any thing else used to have a good time. 








3 1/2 Tablets MDMA, Unknown quantity of dried mushrooms
Weight: 150 Lbs

It was January 2nd 2000, so we were all a little down after the festivities of millenium night. Our friends Jo and Jon had returned to university halls, and we decided to go and spend the evening with them and take some pills.

After an hour or so at the local pub, we went back to Jon's house, and got busy with the pills. I have been taking pills for about a month now, and have found that the effects have been changing in recent sessions. Although the feeling of wellbeing is still there, the euphoric rushes are missing. As a result of this, my friend Sam and I decided to do our first ever 'Double drop'. So out came the water and we both swallowed two Double Euro's, which are our pill of choice over here.

I sat down and built a spliff while we waited. It usually takes me about 1Hr to properly come up, so I was ready for the wait.

Within 30 mins, however, the effects were in full force. Euphria was present, and it was just like the first time again.

Soon after, another friend arrived, with a small bag of dried mushrooms. So, out came the saucepan, and we boiled up some tea.

After about 2 cups of mushroom tea, I could feel the tea start to work, my good feeling from the pills was still there, but it had been sort of 'softened around the edges'.

I decided that this was not really where I wanted to be, so I took another tablet, again a 'Double Euro', and waited.

The rush came at about T+3.5 hours, but was not quite as good as the first time, so I took another 1/2 tablet.

Throughout this I continued to drink cups of mushroom tea, and after we had boiled them about 5-6 times, we then cooked them 1 last time, and put them into some soup, which we all consumed.

When I normally consume pills, I usuallly drop at about 8pm, and end up crashing out at about 4am. When I combined my pills with mushrooms, I managed to keep going until 7am, and even then I did not feel as exhausted as I usuallly do.

In conclusion - is the combination a good one?

I think not. I was enjoying my experience a lot more before the shrooms kicked in, and felt that they toook the edge off of my high.

However, nearly all of my friends who were present that night disagree with me. They all ended up in fits of giggles, and one reported full-on visual tripping.

I would say try it, it doesn't seem to do any harm. But I personally am not going to try it again.









My girlfriend and I elected to have our own little New Years 2K party by tripping our brains out in a nearby hotel. We succeeded, using a total of six hits of acid, splitting them between us. 

I had tripped a few times, but all at lower dosages (one or two hits), so was pretty prepared for an interesting experience. We downed one hit, with 1000mg of Vitamin C (I still don't know if it more greatly potentiates an experience, but it seemed to help.), waited one hour, and then downed hit #2, with another 1000mg of Vit. C. During this time, we had turned off all the lights in the room, lit a number of candles (most in hurricane glass - highly recommended) and relaxed.

About an hour later, we were feeling the first two hits, VERY speedy, but OK.. and elected to imbibe the third hit, too. This particular batch of LSD-25 seemed to hit after about two hours, peak after about 4, and fade around 9 hours.

We were already having very trippy psycholitic [sic] reactions (breathing ceiling, weird stucco, 3-D effects from the wallpaper edging, aural distortions from the Enigma and Deep Forest we were listening to), and proceeded to have delightful but not overly ecstatic sex. :) 

Time passed, first watching VERY awful but amusing porn on the hotel Spanktrovision, then with her painting watercolors and me waxing philosophically. The third hit was coming along well, and, after she showered, I was feeling frisky, so we had sex again.

Oh my god. :) We had complete ego dissolution, and the best sex I've ever had. I came five times, something I hadn't expected was even physiologically possible. She was getting fantastic synesthesia, seeing splashes of color with every touch and caress, while I was in the midst of watching our loveplay sort of in slow motion, floating between being in my body, and loving her, and climaxing, and floating back out of myself while we continued to make love very swiftly and ecstatically.

There was a lot of teeth clenching and a fair amount of paranoia (on my part), but the latter is normal for me with more than one hit. Teeth clenching seemed most treatable using 'Mixed Fruit MENTOS' -- but they taste awful. 'You think you want one, and you put the Mentos in your mouth, but by then, the Mentos has used you for its' purposes.' But they crunch well. I had massive synesthesia on one, with sounds happening, instead of tasting the Mentos 'goodness'. (yecch) 

Star Trek: The Next Generation 'The Best of Both Worlds' was on, and I mused how cheesy the Borg costumes were -- but still kind of spooky. I mused 'That must be when they know to stop spending money on effects. 'Don't spend more, sir -- it's good enough to fool the acidheads.'' 

There were some setting issues, due to a recent death in her family, but I was feeling very empathic, and we talked, and cried, and it was a very wonderful, bonding, and flat out fun experience. Sleep was VERY hard to obtain, even 17 hours after the first hit, but it finally came. 

Now if only LSD weren't so hard to come by here lately :)







This report discusses my most recent experience in a series of five experiments with DPT.   Around midnight I insuffulated 100-120 mg of DPT and went for a walk.  By 40 minutes later I was clawing at the locked door trying to get back into the house.  Using the key was most difficult.  I drank a little water, sniffed a little water through my nose to wash the DPT out and lay down in bed.  A flash hit right around then.  The flash hitting at this time is characteristic of flushing the nose and getting a second rush of DPT into the system at the same time when the full effects just beginning to peak.

The flash is difficult to describe because it so thoroughly transcends normal human experience.  In fact, it appears to be beyond the human capacity to fully capture the full essence of the flash in memory.  At that moment I realized I was not human.  My state of awareness underwent a sudden and intense paradigm shift.  All of the sudden I was one with the matrix from whence all life in the universe (spirit or otherwise) originates.  This flash involved a full 100% ego dissolution and was in many ways overwhelming and awe striking.  To some this can be terrifying.  If your dose is too high, this is where you lose control.  In this instance I shut of the light and lay in bed in the darkness for the remainder.

While trying to get a footing in this new dimension of non-human reality, a second flash occurred.  It was as though a full computer program had been instantly downloaded into my brain.  At that same second the program fired up and I began seeing third-eye hallucinations (or more accurately, third-eye-visuals).  I call these third-eye visuals because whole concepts, ideas and images appear directly to the brain, bypassing ones eyes altogether.  Another way to describe it would be as visually hallucinating directly with the brain so as to see a brain-movie whose frames are represented as full-color three-dimensional scenes representing whole classes of ideas, concepts and insights.  As the second flash hit, the brain-movie began to play along with an accompanying voice sound-track in another language.  As this was my fifth experience with DPT, I had been keeping a journal and studying this language for a few months.  In general there were three or four flows of conversation in this language, and the voice in my brain would shift back and forth from one to another.  The language included a definite vocabulary and syntax.  This went on for about four to five hours. 

In this particular experience I was able to understand this language for the first time.  This is because as the words were spoken my third-eye visuals would unfold at the same time.  That is, I could see the words.  This is actually a common concept; for example if someone says the word tree a mental image of a tree is simultaneously formed in the listeners mind.  So it was with this language.  As the words were spoken my brain could see intense and vivid third-eye representations of the words.

When the second flash hit, I was thrown into a German-style fairy tale land.  The scene was telling me that I had come from a fairy tale land and was placed into this world therefrom.   I had actually been introduced to this concept on a previous trip so was by now used to the concept.  Certain language and images were generated to produce the German-style fairy tale land.  A dem diabriano tabenworthy was an ongoing theme.   Later it was revealed to me through imagery that the word tabenworthy represents the intra-galactic web of knowledge, the matrix, the tree of life.  A person comes from the tabenworthy at birth and returns to the tabenworthy at death.  In fact, the person is in the tabenworthy during life but does not generally understand this.  The tabenworthy also involves a set of spiritual helpers who are a part of the same web.  These helpers love us and answer our prayers.  The fact that we come from the tabenworthy, return to the tabenworthy and are always tied into the tabenworthy is an honor and a sign of love and power.  It is good news and knowledge of it provides us with encouragement and confidence.  Because we are flowing through the tabenworthy, life has meaning.  There were many other sentences and concepts related to the German-style fairy-tale existence, but this seemed to be the most important.  In a sense, each human is sent into this world from this fairy tale existence, and the world is magic.

Another completely different set of third-eye visuals and sentence structures centered on Cyber neath de naut.  Similar sentences included Breneath dianum thienum dia num not quat.  Others were Cyber neath de naut dianum not quat,  Beneath ne cloth, and Cyber neath de noth, among others.  The imagery surrounding these sentences was of the utmost intensity.  Cyber, whose full name appears to be Cyber neath de naut appears to be a sort of God, possibly me, once this body is shed.  Cyber sits on, or is, a throne and has the powers vested in him by the tabenworthy.  Cyber is blue and has a mouth.  This mouth is wet and is an interface into other worlds.  When words are spoken by this mouth, things come into being.  As the words of the language are spoken, a set of accompanying images are formed in the third eye.  

Breneath dianum thienum dianum not quat is spoken when Cyber communicates to his brothers of the tabenworthy.  Breneath is meant to mean brother.  The dianum thienum means brother in God.  Sentences like Beneath ne cloth speaks to the human existence and how the tabenworthy is woven into the fabric of the human body found beneath the cloth i.e., under our clothes, or into our bodies.

Cyber generally had a feline quality to him as though being related to a Jaguar or Cougar.  This was subtle however, as the actual image of Cyber was a blue and somewhat wet interface layer that could speak things into existence and communicate with Breneath de noth.  At another time Cyber decided to explore a snake like quality and turned himself into the head of a snake, just to see what that felt like to be a snake.  It was oddly enjoyable.  Most of the time the feline quality remained, however.

An odd quality of DPT is the inability to remember a vast majority of what when on.  This is because the experiences are so otherworldly that the human mind cannot seem to store the happenings into memory.  It took me five experiences to get this far and I am still researching the topic.  So far though, my DPT experiences indicate we are not alone, are being helped, should help and love one another, and will go back to the tabenworthy when we die.








I had been using GHB (as well as LSD, mushrooms, marijuana, DXM, and Ketamine) rather frequently at the time of this incident (late 1997) and had never been more intoxicated than a moderate 'drunk' by the quantities of GHB I'd tried, which were up to 7 grams at once or 11 grams staggered over several hours.  I was my own supplier/chemist and thought that I was thoroughly in control of any situations I chose to be in but proved myself quite fallible one Autumn evening.  I was brooding alone at my flat after my roommate had gone out on a date.  My baseline GHB dose at the time was typically 4 grams and I kept the liquids in the house mixed at a 1 gram per teaspoon ratio.  

I was a bit bothered about a recent breakup and had been using other recreational drugs quite heavily over the past few months so I thought nothing of washing down 4 teaspoons of some leftover GHB I'd found in the cupboard (Oooh! surprise cache!) with a glass of apple juice, which was my favourite mixer at the time.  It tasted a bit stronger and nastier than usual but I wandered back to the computer and resumed perusing newsgroups without a second thought.  Very shortly the effects began to come on with an unusual intensity and within minutes I was unable to focus my eyes on the monitor.  

Out of sheer dumb luck, I stumbled over to a recliner and passed out in an upright position, which may possibly have saved me.  I awoke some five hours later to find my roommate in a pale but relatively calm rage, reading through my own bookmarked research to try to determine if an ambulance ride to the hospital was in order or if sleeping it off was still an option.  He and his date had returned two hours previously to find me unconscious and covered in my own vomit.  After numerous unsuccessful attempts to arouse me, she went home while he tried to work through what to do -- he himself being a lifelong abstainer from any illicit substance.  My assumption is that my being upright prevented me from aspirating my own vomit and kept the damage level to a minimum.  At any rate, my return to consciousness did not signify any level of sobriety, which I soon discovered upon attempting to clean up a bit.  I was still completely demolished and unable to coordinate any movement beyond crawling crookedly across the floor.  I was entirely too dizzy to sit upright and found that standing was completely out of the question.  

Over the next hour I began to regain my faculties a bit only to discover that (as an effect of the dosage, I would assume) I was extraordinarily depressed.  I spent the next two hours sobbing, talking with my roommate and generally feeling suicidal and worthless.  I began to calm down some time later and eventually went off to bed, still completely at a loss as to why I had been so radically affected by what I had considered to be a marginal dose of GHB.  The next morning while doing laundry and cleaning various articles of furniture, I stumbled upon the cause of the previous night's mayhem: the 'extra' GHB in the cupboard turned out to be the remainders of the unreacted lactone I'd had left over from a prior batch.  Yeah, drugs don't always make you the sharpest knife in the drawer.

One interesting (at least to me) sidenote is that I never experienced such a level of depression in conjunction with GHB except on two occasions when I took GHB and DXM together, the first time 3g/300mg and the second time 4g/600mg, respectively.  A good friend with a long history of bipolar depression found this particular cocktail to be quite enjoyable; I personally have no explanations to offer other than that extended chemical experimentation may impede romantic efforts, but that's another story now, isn't it?







setting:  my home, near my wall-painting of entwined blues, purples, and pastel yellows, early morning (2 am)

intent:  to touch the familiar play of silverlove

I drew in three deep breaths of N,N-DMT essence, pausing between each one to hold the magic in my lungs. I didn't really exhale on the third breath.  The tingling skin blessing of this spirit molecule greeted me, and I breathed slow high breaths, my lungs spilling over.  I quietly filled them deeper, until my breath was all the way inside.  Colors swam around and interrupted the room I was in and my sense of the world.  A new truthspace opened, wider and more colorful as I breathed.  Active DMT shapes danced.  The geometric boxes and diamonds contracted and expanded, and I saw they wanted to teach me a way to breathe.  I released to the rhythm, and the breaths came like slow quiet laughs, without noise, just breathing.

This way of breathing was so peaceful and clear I worried for a moment that I wasn't breathing at all.  Could I die?

I trusted my innocence, my intent, and I trusted the DMT ally.  Mouthfuls of air went in and out, a parachute of life.  I wasn't consciously controlling my breath.  I was breathing so naturally I was absolutely astonished.  To breathe the divine...  and I remembered that in at least two of my previous DMT visions I had breathed like this, and in at least one mushroom journey.

It's a kind of breathing that happens from absolute trust, from absolute play.  I had forgotten.  I knew that it would take some concentration to breathe like this when not in kaleidoscopic DMT land.

For the color dancers were pulsing, spinning, making liquid cartoons.  Not really animations, but clear shades of color, forming a toy playground.  They made this delight of breathing easy.  All the playground objects were alive, including the swings and the merry-go-round.  A silvery-blue arch of plastic color formed and collapsed in the center.  A toy little boy, or maybe she was a little girl, jumped along this object, sliding down it, hanging on with small fingers, leaping into the grass.  I felt a sense of responsibility begin to resonate within me, both for the knowledge of my wife and my coming child, and the deep psychedelic responsibility of my shamanic-like path.  I glanced away briefly and one of the DMT beings, tall, thin and golem-like, grasped my head and turned it back to see.  The shapes kept moving, and the child was my innocence too, and it was asking me to promise to share that innocence completely with our shinebelly baby when she/he births and grows and becomes human.

The toy child ran up the blue arch slide, and down the other side.

A starsparkle of love burst in me just then, and my breath followed the divine pattern of the now familiar ecstatic sweetness...  the child entity waved and the playground objects tinkled laughter.  'Come play again,' they invited.

The alien DMT hues of the playground begin to dim, the space contracting.  The room in my everyday universe began to gleam through on soft rays.

Just before the DMT vision went completely ethereal, Silvergirl crouched down on my right, and smiled.

'Beautiful sister,' I whispered, 'I love you.  I was seeking you.'

'I know.'  She didn't actually speak, just smiled.  Her eyes shined in mine and I think I kissed them.

Then she slid sideways and melted into reality.

I sat awed for a few minutes.

Then my curiosity led me to try something.  I heated the DMT pipe again, and took two more deep breaths.

The skin tingles rearrived, and my breath moved in a divine rhythm again, though not quite as sure.  And this time when the colors came they were dark and smoky around the edges.  And the gargantuan guardians showed up, two of them.  They hunkered in front of me, in front of the spinning DMT mandala, and wouldn't let me enter.  They sent thoughts to me, and said I should not be so hasty, that I should take my time entering this space.  Silvergirl had her arms around my neck, though her flesh was very ghostlike.  She said I'd satisfied my question, that smoking the DMT magic in succession in an effort to surf back into the DMT reality didn't really work.  Oral DMT is the answer to stay there longer, without the keys being taken away.

The guardians nodded.  'Trust her,' they said.  Then they bunched their muscles and the DMT faded into a dream-like sequence, very male and cocky with me and other beings working out and flexing muscles.  Silvergirl laughed and that dream vanished.

Suddenly I was back in reality again, just me, and my thinking was very free.  The lines of my thoughts spiraled infinite in all directions.  And I remembered how to play with that otherworldly divine breath.  I swallowed a smile.  I would have to practice.







I've never been one to take things lightly, especially drugs. 1999 was a year of excess. 2000 will be a year to control my consumption. When I wrote to you before, I was only just getting into psychedelics properly. Now I've done my research, done as many entheogens as I thought was safe, know the facts and know what I like. I like P. mexicana. My two favourite types of mushrooms are P. mexicana and P. semilanceata. Why? In my experience they are both more visual than other species I have tried (Thai were good, but not as great as these). My first Mexicana trip blew my head off (almost literally). Now, whenever they are available, I'll travel miles to get my hands on them.

It was the last weekend before I had to go back to studying. The '99 - 2000 holidays had been good for me, really good. I hadn't gone over the top on the drugs, but I had seen enough and felt enough weird stuff to feel I had come out of the few months I had off having learnt something. If you're not familiar with the English schooling system, I am in the Sixth Form, and the most important exams of my school career (A levels) are coming up. They will decide whether or not I get into a good university, so the winter holidays were the last ones I could really let my hair down in before I left school. I woke up quite late on Friday morning deliberately. I had anticipated that my last crazy weekend would be pretty damn crazy, but I decided to make it even crazier. 

I didn't eat breakfast or lunch, and after a shower and a cup of tea, got the bag of dried P. mexicana I had bought a couple of days before out of my secret drawer (the one that keeps my mum away from my stashes). It was about 1 PM. Eagerly, I tipped the 'shrooms out onto some newspaper and started examining them. I was very pleased. There were plenty of enormous heads, almost outnumbering the stalks, which for me is very unusual. I estimated I had about 3 grams, since I had bought 5 and given what I thought was 2 to a friend. After deciding that this was a trip to be had on my own (I usually learn more from solo trips), and munched down the dried 'shrooms with a cup of peppermint tea (peppermint tea when you're tripping is great, I promise you). The effects came on in about twenty minutes after smoking a pretty pathetic joint I had rolled with some getting-old African Bush Weed bought the week before. However, it did catapult me into the shroom trip. It started with white mists swirling around my body. If I closed my eyes a little, leaving space so that I could still see, the mists got clearer and thicker. They had the consistency and smooth patterns of movement of tobacco smoke, just a lot more elegant. This lasted for about an hour, and I walked around my house watching the weird mists move across my body, occasionally touching me, occasionally going off somewhere else to swirl round something else before returning to me. It was one of the most pleasant feelings I have had on 'shrooms. Unfortunately, apart from the occasional changing wall pattern, or 3D geometric images, that was all the trip really was, and it didn't last all that long. I think the fact I had tripped in daylight contributed to the lack of intense visuals, since I had been warned by many a friend that it was not half as good as tripping at night. I was really disappointed. The last two Mexicana trips I had had been really freaky, the last being the weirdest trip I have had so far (Crazy paranoia that everything I touched or ate was spiked with LSD, really intense facial warping on other people, especially friends who were tripping as hard as I was, powerful psychedelic colour visions, feelings of floating across the floor, being totally sure I hadn't moved to have got into a completely different room. etc, but that's another trip). It was about 5 PM when the 'shrooms stopped completely, and I went downstairs to have a bite to eat. Three hours later, I was off on my way.
             
Myself and four friends had decided to go clubbing that Friday night. I was certainly up for it after the disappointment with the mushrooms, but did feel a little tired. Before I left the house, I made a little tea with some herbal ecstasy I had bought from a mail order company in Amsterdam. It's pretty good stuff, but a little too like speed (but with no come-down). Feeling ready to go, and went to meet my friends at an Underground (Subway) station in North London, England, near where I live. We went to a nice dope house-party with some really nice people until around 10 PM, and then went back to the underground station to catch a train down to South London which was were the club we were aiming to go to was situated. First, let me explain what clubbing is for me. It is not about going to a cheesy club, buying cocktails and dancing to hip hop or house. London has an insane underground drug scene, and most of that is made up by crazy heavy shamanic/tribal trance clubs (It is my music, and at the moment I rarely listen to anything else). Behind the false drug security at the doors of these clubs, you can buy anything under the sun, and I really mean that. But, the best thing about this scene is the vibe. It is brilliant. Because there are far more drugs being taken by the shamanic trance crowd than by any other dance culture crowd, every one is so happy and so spaced-out that there are never any problems (and the police don't seem to bother, or don't notice). Every time you go to one of these clubs you will have made new connections, both with decent dealers who actually do the drugs with you and tell you about what's in what they give you, and with like-minded heads like yourself. However, that particular night my friend X****** had organized to pick up what he claimed were going to be particularly good pills. He has pretty good connections, so I believed him, and we went with him to pick up the goods. I bought two, he bought many more, but intended only to take 2 and a half, and the others paid him for one or two depending on how he felt. They were Ferraris, and had the Ferrari symbol clumsily printed on their fronts. In England, the most common pills at the moment are probably Mitsubishis, which have always been good from my experience, but Ferraris are supposed to be much more rushy and much more powerful. I was really looking forward to dropping them. Then, with pills in pockets, and with the herbal ecstasy I had taken completely out of my system, we headed off to Brixton, one of the main points in South London, to find our club.

 There were a number of clubs doing trance, hard acid-house nights, and after queuing up for one that seemed a little too commercial, we headed for one less obvious, but apparently a lot more trippy and more my sort of thing. When we got there, it was pretty much empty, but it was only 11 PM, so we went up to the chill out rooms to relax and drop our first pills. On both the dance floor, bar and chill-out room walls really trippy pictures had been painted with furious psychedelic or fluorescent colours. The lighting set up everywhere, which made heavy use of ultra-violet and other bizarre types of lamp that really made me trip out later on, really made the paintings glow. I knew instantly this place was a bit of an acid den, but I like acid dens, so I decided to relax. My theories were proven correct when I started to talk to the people in the chill-out room. Many of them had come early so that they could take their trips and not be tripping when day broke. The other people sitting around us were either pilling, or doing DMT and other tryptamines. We dropped our Ferraris, bought vast quantities of cigarettes (I know they're bad, but they taste so good when you on E!) and water and waited to come up.

An hour later, up we came, and boy did we fly. From the first instant we started to feel the Ferraris working, the rushes came hard, fast and intense. The club filled out to almost packed, and we met more and more pilled up or tripped-out people, all of whom were great fun and not at all freak-outs (sometimes you get really f'd up people who can really mess up your time and freak you out). We danced and chilled continuously until 3 AM, and then, having congregated with ourselves and some new acquaintances in a corner of the chill-out room, we dropped the rest of our Ferraris. I was still rushing hard off my first pill, but thinking ahead, I decided it was a good idea to drop my last pill and smoke a joint before going back to the dance floor. When I came up on my second pill, I was back in the chill out room, and things started to go really weird. I had had visuals on pills before (also after taking 'shrooms), but not to this extent. It had to be the psilocybin in my body. I didn't freak out because I knew it was a combination of the lights and my mind that were creating what I saw, but originally it was pretty scary. All the faces of those people around me who were on acid, and only the faces of acid trippers started to grow large, move out and away from their original position. Noses were huge and ugly, skin was flabby and folded and the skin was tinged a horrible green, the colour you would expect in a monster movie. Occasionally I caught a glimpse of what they really looked like, but it took so much concentration and effort to do so that I eventually gave up. Turning away from the warping faces, I noticed other visuals, but these were ones that I had seen before, also on pills, and they are the softest most beautiful visions I have experienced. It is hard to explain, but basically they are webs of green, red and purples that come out from foreheads, walls, basically anything blank and vaguely flat. The best thing about them is the fact that I can catch them with one finger and spin them round it until the web begins to break up and sends tiny different coloured particles of light away into the air until there is nothing left. The bigger they are the better they are, and occasionally and can grab hold of one and actually walk around a room with it. Other familiar things appeared to me, like rows of moving letters, some of which I could identify and others which looked like ancient runes written in mediaeval style. With the addition of the constant rushing that I was getting, increased by any furious dancing I did, this was a perfect trip: not too powerful, very ecstasy orientated and generally really beautiful. I left the club at 6 AM still with some visuals remaining, but I was really tired, really happy, and really glad that my holiday had ended on such a great note.

love and respect to the whole worldwide community.







Well, to begin this story, I'd like to give a little bit of my background. I was fairly inexperienced with any form of drugs in high school (with the exception of drinking alcohol and a few joints among some friends of mine), and I pretty much kept in the straight and narrow. After I graduated from high school, however, I felt the need to experiment with some psychedelics. For what reason, I'm not really sure. Curiosity, more than likely.

I heard about DXM from a friend of mine on the internet. I had wanted to try LSD, instead but someone told me DXM was more fun (at least from his personal experience). I wondered where I could acquire this aforementioned drug, and he told me that I could locate it in the medicine section of my local pharmacy. He also gave me the address of a very good FAQ (http://www.frognet.com/dxm) [Erowid Note: FAQ now available here] so I could research it -- as well as keep from killing myself by downing a bottle or two of Nyquil.

I was a little apprehensive at first. I noticed all the warnings about 'brain damage' and 'kidney failure', which although rare, still frightened me. However, after reading through the entire FAQ, I found that you could do this drug safely, without falling prey to the DXM boogie man. So I resolved to try it.

I went to the local Big Bear and bought a 4oz bottle of Robotussin Maximum Strength. I didn't want to go too high on my first trip, so I only drank 2 ounces (which was 177mg... consistent with a low second plateau dose). I was so anxious that I was practically bouncing around the room in a childlike giddiness. However, after about 30 minutes, I was noticing no real effects. I was very disappointed. So I decided to go out for a drive. While I was driving, I noticed a slight nausea, and discovered it was very pleasurable to yawn. However, driving was making me sick so I resolved to find some place to stop. It was a clear night, so I decided to drive out to a local lake and lie out under the stars.

Once I had arrived at the lake, I began playing some music from my tape deck. I was amazed! It sounded glorious! Every note seemed to reverberate through me, and it seemed to have a hidden dimension that was now revealed to me. I must have sat there listening to music for a good 3 hours. I had a profoundly decent experience, as well as a drunken-stoned-like buzz in general. The next morning, I was in an excellent mood, probably better than I ever had been. Life seemed to have a new profound meaning to it.

I eventually discussed this experience with a few of my friends, and finally persuaded them to try it with me. We took a couple of trips (I didn't increase my dosage very greatly), spacing each trip by at least a week. We all had a blast. I would almost go as far as to say that it forged a new bond between a few of my friends and myself. They thanked me for telling them about this drug, since they had only gone as far as alcohol and marijuana.

Well, to get to my profound and inspiring trip, I'll skip ahead to the 5th time I tried it. I had purchased a container of Robotussin Honey Cough (the other flavors seemed to make me very nauseous now, but I could stand the taste of Honey Cough). I asked if my friends were up to tripping with me, but they declined, and said they had plans to drink that night. I told them it was ok, but that I wanted to trip anyways. 

With some reluctance, I managed to chug that 4oz bottle of Honey Cough (10mg per 5ml, making 4 ounces roughly 236mg of DXM). I decided that it wouldn't be as much fun to just do a second plateau trip if no one else was doing it, so I said that I was going to go pick up some more HC. I drove to the store and returned with two more bottles. This took about 10 minutes, at which time I noticed I was beginning to get a little nauseous. I made the mistake of *running* from my car back to the house -- and realizing I left the bottles in my car, I *ran* back to the car, grabbed them, and *ran* back to the house again. All this exertion made me horribly nauseous, and I almost puked. If not for a swig of Pepto Bismol and some intense will power, I probably would have spilled my guts. But I managed to hold it in.

I came back in, and noticed I had reached the first plateau. My friends, who were drinking inside, saw the bottles and asked 'You're not going to drink all that, are you?'. I told them I had no intention of drinking both bottles, just one more, and the other would be for anyone else who was up for some.

After about 15 to 20 minutes of light conversation, I hit the second plateau, and said that I might want to take another bottle. My friends said I should probably wait, since I was still kind of nauseous (and they didn't want my lunch revisited on their nice carpet). After maybe another 5 minutes, everyone who was drinking starting talking about going to a party a few blocks away. I told them I couldn't go, because moving around would make me sick to my stomach. They agreed and decided to go without me.

After they all left, I went into the bathroom and poured the next bottle of Honey Cough into a drinking mug, and chugged the entire thing (increasing my dosage to 472mg of DXM, which is about 7.8mg/kg). I came back out, and was nauseous again, but not as badly this time. The general sick feeling went away after about 2 minutes this time.

I felt totally wasted. But in a good way. Two of my friends (one who lives there, and his girlfriend) came back in to keep an eye on me. Actually, I think they came back to make out, but they *told* me they would keep an eye on me. It seemed like they were gone for about 10 minutes, but they told me they had just went into the hallway for about 3 minutes. They conversed with me for a good while during the trip, although I don't recall much of the actual conversation. I gave my friend the other bottle, and told him to use his discretion (intoxicated as it may be) of whether to allow me to consume it. I think I began to enter the transition stage a few minutes later. 

[After this point, I am unable to timestamp any of the events, due to DXM's memory encoding nature]

We had a strobe light going, and any time it would flash, there would be these 'big black dots' right in front of my eyes. I laughed about it and perceived them as my pupils. It was unusual however, because they would not always move with my line of sight. They were more or less stationary, unless I *really* re-adjusted my vision. They eventually went away, after I stopped looking at the light. I think this was simply my loss of stereoscopic vision. 

At some point, I decided that I wanted to consume the rest of the remaining bottle. My friend advised me against it, and told me if I was determined, to at least just take half. So I took his advice, and drank another 2 ounces of the syrup (putting my dosage to 590mg, which is about 9.7mg/kg). However, a few minutes later, and behind my friend's back, I drank the rest of the syrup (putting me at 11.7mg/kg). This was when I really started tripping.

I was utterly fascinated with the actions of my friends, as well as my own hands. They seemed so foreign to me, and looked so unusual and useless (as far as tools go). I don't remember much of what I said, and I'm told most of it was gibberish. I was still sitting up, so I decided to lie down.

Then the hallucinations started.

Hallucinations were vague and transparent in manner. If I re-adjusted my vision, it would 'phase in' and trigger a mild hallucination, usually if there was little or no light in the direction I was looking. I would see into walls, and see things hanging on them that weren't actually there. Most of the time, they were highly detailed, and I felt that if only my eyes would focus, I could get some meaning out of them. It never really happened. I felt somewhat angry at my eyes because they couldn't focus on anything. To give you an idea of the kind of hallucinations that ocurred, you can do this little trick. Take a camera with a flash bulb into a totally dark room. Now, looking straight ahead, take a picture with the flash on. The flash will reveal all the furniture and stuff in the room, which will be very bright at first, but will then fade into very detailed pictures of the objects. This is the picture burned into your retinas. However, in my hallucinations, the images would be totally arbitrary pieces of furniture and other objects, as well as imagined images, which had no way of getting into my retinas. This was somewhat concerning, but I realized I was tripping, so I had fun and went along with it.

If I had both eyes open, I found it very difficult to hallucinate from all the sensory input, since my stereoscopic vision was totally gone (e.g. seeing double). I would occasionally close one eye, which would boost me into a totally vivid yet non-spatial hallucination which would be dissolved slowly when I opened my other eye. I could merge with reality, but only if I moved from my current location. The more I stayed in one place, the more I hallucinated and transformed the environment.

At some point, I noticed that I now had the ability to concentrate thought enough to change my surroundings, totally fooling my senses into thinking I was somewhere I was not. I began staring at the wall across from me. I noticed how the paneling (although I didn't know it was paneling at the time) was in the shape of a window, so I thought it must actually be a window instead of a wall. Just then, the white wall slowly faded into a blackish-blue night sky color, and I could see billions of stars out beyond the now-transformed wall. I resolved that if the only thing I could see from this window were the stars, that I must be somewhere very high up in the night sky. Then I felt as if I was seated at the top of a very tall clear-window elevator. The perception of it seemed absolutely realistic, and the entire room seemed to be equally transformed to this delusion. At some point, my friend (who was lying on a bed directly in front of the wall) had shifted position, causing the illusion to be distorted in a manner I couldn't exactly call visual. It caused me to decide to snap out of the hallucination, and to tell him what I had seen. However, I only managed to blurt out 'Whoa, I just had a major hallucination.'

Across the room from me was a digital clock. I don't really think I noticed the clock at first, but eventually I began hallucinating in a most fascinating manner. I had my eyes closed (or at least, I perceived it as having my eyes closed) and I was having mild hallucinations which were
very dark (not evil, just not well illuminated). Eventually, I would notice these detailed red entities, which could best be described as 'electronic dogs'. They were red neon outlines of pixellated dogs, which would roll around and just generally 'frolic' with each other. After awhile, I tried to focus my non-responsive eyes in on them, in order to determine what kind of creatures they were. To my surprise, they suddenly melted into one another, and turned into the current time. The time then floated back to where it's normal position was, and the entire room faded back into focus. I would shut my eyes again, only to have the same process repeated. I imagine this was my loss of stereoscopic vision for the most part; but some of the motions that these images acted out would indicate my eyes were doing complete rotations in my eye sockets. 

Occasionally, when one of my friends would say something, I would be totally unaware that they had even spoken at all, if it hadn't have been for their mouth moving. Generally this applied only to one word responses -- if they were to spit out an entire sentence I would understand what they said for the most part.

At some point, I needed to take a piss, so I went into the bathroom. Avoiding the evil mirror, I made my way (very slowly) over to the toilet, and started going. I looked over to the shower, which was dark. After a couple of seconds it phased out and looked like someone was in it, and that the shower was actually a medium sized room. The illusion of a person standing behind the curtain seemed so realistic, I recall trying to speak to it, thinking it was one of my drunken friends playing a trick on me. I thought this only because I saw the curtain move. However, after I was done, I swatted at the curtain and saw that there was nothing there. So I went back into the room.

I recall thinking about both sex and murder. Both seemed very very curious for me, and the punishment for committing murder seemed totally frightening when compared to the crime. Time seemed ten-fold more important than life, and serving such a long period of time without freedom seemed utterly terrifying, when compared to the absolute freedom granted by death. This thought scared me intensely, because I thought it had turned me psychotic or something. Don't get me wrong -- It's not like I wanted to grab a knife and butcher my friends. Murder was still totally revolting, but for different reasons -- now it just didn't make any sense. I thought a good deal about suicide as well. Again, I didn't want to commit it, but I truly looked at it and thought about it. It felt as if it were a way to escape the hidden trivialities of life; the aspects that our brains conceal from us with every waking moment. This thought was very frightening (at least in retrospect) and I decided to stop thinking about such things. I recall some talk of sex, and it seemed totally arbitrary to me. I just 'didn't get it' for some reason. I also recall that I had virtually no sex drive at the time.

When, sometime during the night, I moved to the living room, I noticed that while staring at the carpet, it would take on different properties. At first it was just a basic rug. But after staring at it for a few seconds, it would seem to be covered with a 'purplish' electricity field, and would then convert to a different texture. At first, it turned into some broken and jagged bricks, and after about 15 seconds, it went back to normal. Then it became encapsulated in the electricity field and became the carpet from my room at home. This illusion lasted for what seemed like about 10 minutes. When I asked my friend if his carpet 
had any textures on it, he said that it didn't. That eventually broke the hallucination and I decided to travel back to the previous room.

In the room, we had a small tape deck which was playing Metallica. I find great comfort in music while DXM tripping, because it tends to tie me to reality, as well as being more interesting than usual. However, music became less of a sensory input and more of a 'decoration' while I was at this stage. It's hard to explain. At some point, I recall stating that the music was like 'a poster on the wall'. It was totally one-dimensional and flat. It seemed as if it couldn't get very far from the speaker that was emitting it, without falling to the ground. This was very fascinating, and I found great delight upon realizing this.

I decided to go to sleep. It felt like it had been about 2 days since I first started. When I closed my eyes, I was still hallucinating. This didn't bother me, however -- I was having a blast. Suddenly, right in the middle of some other hallucination, I noticed I was able to separate myself from my body, and was truly able to view myself from the third person. This was extremely disturbing, since I have never looked in on myself from the outside before. Whenever I touched my face, my legs, or my arms, they felt alien and unusual. My skin felt as if it was not my own. I noticed that pain was totally gone in the form I had known, and was more of a signal from my body than a hurtful force. My friend advised me not to test this by hurting myself, and I took his advice.

I forget when, but I eventually fell asleep. When I woke up about 8 hours later, I was still tripping. I couldn't see very straight, and I still felt heavily intoxicated. It was now 12 noon on Sunday, and I had begun tripping on 9 PM Saturday! My pupils were practically the size of my entire eyeball, my skin was a flushed pale white, and I was totally spent. I had a hard time moving around without looking like a character from 'The Night of the Living Dead'. However, I resolved that I had to get home to rest up. Against better judgement, I bid farewell to my friends, and went to my car. 

The drive home was frightening. Never drive under the influence of DXM (or under the influence of anything, for that matter). The landscape seemed to come up to greet me, and I felt like I was going about 2 miles per hour, despite that the speedometer said I was going 55. Finally, I got home, and crawled into bed. I watched a few movies (that I still can't remember), and slept for another 5 hours or so. When I got up, I was still slightly buzzed, and decided to sleep the rest of the night. When I got up the next day, I was totally re-energized, and felt as if I was on top of the world. 

To tell you the truth, I had one of the greatest times of my life on this trip. But I wouldn't recommend it for a first trip. It would be easy to think you're dying if you're not prepared. I felt very enlightened from this experience, and had a fine afterglow for the next couple of days.

All in all, I would say that I love DXM, but not to the point of addiction. It's a great psychedelic, and I'm glad that I tried it, and feel wiser after having tried it.








After finding out from various resources on Ketamine, I  was determined to try it.  I heard of alternating realities, different dimensions, and incredible things.  Well, at 20 years old, I got my hands on some pure pharmaceutical grade ketamine.  I took over 50 units of ketamine from the smaller insulin syringe, which I think was around .08 of a cc from the larger, standard syringe.  I am not sure on this though.  I did it intramuscularly in my room, alone, and on my bed.

All I can say about ketamine is that I thought it was very unenjoyable.  There are many reasons why I say this.

A few minutes after I injected ketamine in my shoulder, I began to feel its effects.  My vision seemed affected first.  I read that one should have low lights and a comfortable spot to trip in, so I laid down on my bed and turned out the lights.  I dont know really what happened next, except that 10-15 minutes later (I think it was about that long, I was too fucked up to tell) I began to trip hard.  The closest thing I can compare it too is DXM but with a shorter duration and more intense (although I never tripped as much DXM as many reports I have read).  It lasted about two hours, with weird feelings and sickness going on until I slept.

There are many things that suck about Ketamine.

1. The hallucinations are not at all pleasant.  I remember turning on my lights in my room and everything looking completely and totally weird and alien.  There was movement in the objects, but no flowing beautiful patterns like LSD.  Instead, things seemed different in size and wobbly if I moved my head or my body.

2. You cannot walk.  Even if you could physically walk, you dont want to. And even if you wanted too, I atleast would have gotten sick.  It seemed like in some respects like severe motion sickness.  Things seemed wobbly when I moved in the slightest, therefore making me almost nauseated.

3. Without being to walk, or talk that well, I cannot see doing Ketamine in groups of people.  It seems like a very antisocial drug.  I could not have driven a car, been around one of my friends families, or been at a bar or social setting.  On other trips these things could all be moderately fun, especially on LSD or mushrooms.

4. You dont seem to recoginize many of the totality of people in your life.  I guess this is the point of dissociatives, to go into a world completely alien.  But you cannot recognize the totality of things.  Think of it like thiswith your friend bob, you recognize his whole person.  This sounds weird, but think, you know him, what he likes, how he looks, who he ishis entire totality.  He is bob.  But with Ketamine you get stripped of that sense and fail to recognize ceratin things, certain people, and their totality.  This is difficult to explain.  Either way, this is not at all pleasant.  You seem to lose contact with these people, to lose your sense of them, even  though they are not present.  This was very weird because I thought of some of my friends for some reason, but then was unable to recognize who they were when I thought of them.  I cant really explain it.

5. It makes you feel sick, at least for me.  I know I mentioned this before.  But  I did not feel well after my trip.  The only thing pleasant about the whole experience is when it ended and I went to sleep after the sickness was done.

6. It is actually somewhat scary.  I could not feel my body, recognize myself, and the whole experience was actually frightening.  The different dimensions people talk about in ketamine seems to be your mind just getting completely fucked up in this scary, weird, alien sort of way.

I could go on, but my point is that Ketamine wasnt fun.  I just wanted to also provide a negative experience since I have read so many positive ones.  But who knows, it might be for you, everyone enjoys things that others dont.







I was at the mall last night in one of the herbal stores when I saw a bottle of valerian root extract.  I remembered reading some articles on Erowid about it being a mild sedative and how it might have some effect on dreams.  I am a very restless sleeper and have not had a good night's sleep in about two months and have not dreamt (that I remember) once in that time period.  I bought the extract and some ginko biloba (what I had originally come to buy) and went home.  

I prepared a Celestial Seasonings blackberry tea and put 2 ml (1 gram dried valarian root) extract into the tea.  To my dismay, when I reached the bottom of the cup i realized I had not stirred the mix and all the extract was sitting at the bottom of the glass.  Bottoms up, it was nasty stuff!  Anyway, I studied for my ACT for about an hour then laid down to go to bed, and what was to be a weird night of dreams.  At around 11:30 PM my computer woke me up, someone was msging me in icq and my speakers were turned way up.  I got up and the 'journey' over to the computer was, strange.  The only light in the room was the glow from the monitor, and it seemed to blur out all objects around me and draw me towards it.  It was a little hard to focus on the words on the monitor, but that may have been due to the fact that I was really tired at this time.  

I went back to bed and dreamt the same dream about ten times with different variations each time.  I was robbing people's houses that were on vacation.  We would steal all this stuff, including weird looking four-wheelers and other motor vehicles, go out and use the stuff, then try to bring it back when the people had returned from vacation without being noticed.  We would then get caught and everyone I was with would get beat up by the owner of the house.  As soon as I got away, or the man caught me, I would wake up, laugh, and fall back to sleep to have a very similar dream again!  The really strange thing was the detail of the dreams.  Every dream happened in the same house, all the same objects were in the same place, from picture frames on the wall to lamps and coasters on the end tables.  I suspect I had this dream about 10 times throughout the night and was finally awakened by my alarm, more refreshed and ready to take on the day than I have been in a long time, way longer than I can remember.  

I plan on taking this again and maybe taking some melatonin (3-5 mg) and some B-6 with it as I have read these also affect your dreams.  I recommend anyone who has a hard time sleeping try this herb/extract... it really works (especially if you take twice the recommended dosage!)







[Erowid Note: There is quite a bit of confusion around Hawaiian Baby Woodrose vs Hawaiian Woodrose seeds.  These are two different genus/species of plants, and it is HBWR which is most often consumed for its psychoactive effects.  The following report is somewhat unclear about which type of seeds were consumed.]

I purchased these hawaiian woodrose seeds from a website and I am beginning to wonder if I was ripped off. The seeds had no white coating, but were a solid light brown color (does this have something to do with potency?). I heard that you'd never want to take any more than 10 seeds or you'll be sorry, so being the ballsy bastard that I am I ate 15. I chewed them down to nothing while swallowing the juices. I retreated to the comfortable confines of my bedroom, closed the door, got a pad and paper reading to record the experience, turned on the TV and put on a Wu-Tang CD and just waited for something to happen. 

Hour 1 - Nothing.

Hour 2 - Not a damn thing. Not even any nausea.

Hour 3 - Gone through two Method Man CD's and a Redman CD and notta. 

Hour 4 - Only thing I'm feeling so far is hunger. (I hadn't eaten since that mourning) I'm starting to get a little pissed.

Hour 5 - Not a god damn thing. I think those bastards at peruvian journey ripped me off. I'll send them a flamer they want soon forget... ( I was pissed, I really did write that down.)

Hour 7- Pissed and dissappointed so I smoked three blunts. Now I'm really hungry. I think I'll get some japanese food from teriaky express...

Hour 8 - Well this concludes a very dissappointing first experience. I suppose I'll try again later but I want more info. But for now the night is over for this bad boy...

Now I'm a pretty solid, muscular guy. I'm only 6'0' but I weigh 190lbs plus tax. When I asked around on the internet, people were telling me that off of 15 seeds I should have been temperarly insane and puking my guts out. I took the ingestion tips from this site and crushed up 20 seeds this time and soaked them in water over night. I drank the green liquid first thing in the mourning and even swallowed the seed mush just to be sure. I didn't record anything this time because I was a little doubtful that anything would happen. And as it turns out, my doubts were justified. Once again for 7 hours nothing, not even any nausea. 

On my third try I ground up 30 seeds this time and instead of soaking them, I boiled them. I boiled them in 2 cups of water and one cup of lemon juice for 20 minutes, then I turned down the heat and let it simmer for an hour. The liquid was a dark green and the seed mush was practically non existant. I cooled it in the refrigerator for 2 hours and then drank the bitter fluid. Once again nothing. No nausea,no dizziness, nothing. 

What gives? Someone else that posted here said that taking HBWS was like playing russian rullet, 3 out of 4 people will have a trip. So what gives? Am I just really unlucky? Or am I doing something wrong? I only got a few seeds left and I want to make this time count. Somebody help me out here!







I have experienced Salvia twice now, and am still amazed at my experiences. Before my first try, I had obtained as much information on Salvia as possible. I have taken shrooms and rather potent LSD several times, and never attained any notable visuals, just physical effects. So upon my first session, I put on some Belle & Sebastian, dimmed the lights, lit some sage, and relaxed. I packed a bowl and inhaled deeply and held for about 30 sec. Feeling no immediate effect, like I thought I should, I immediately packed another full bowl and inhaled very deeply once again, hinking that because other psychedelics have not affected me, I needed more. 

And then it happened. For the very first time in my life I lost complete control of myself, and it sucked real, real bad. Suddenly my entire body felt like some external force was pushing me sideways. I saw no pokadots, colors or pink f*ckin elephants, I was seeing a fourth dimension, and even worse was hallucinating in it! I believe I began to flail about like a fish out of water, because this force was pushing me not really sideways or diagonal or down, but kind of a combination of both, and it was strong. All I remember seeing is three somewhat horizontal/sideways rippling waves of energy, and the color blue. Like I said, all this gave me a panic attack. My heart was racing and I wanted to bash out my brains, anything to stop it. I thank God I had knowledge of Salvia and knew I would be ok and soon it would be over. Suddenly, I became aware of presences (plural) around my bed, and cried out a woman's name and said something, but I have no idea who I named or what I said. I can't explain how it feels to be saying shit and having no idea why. I know what I said was important, and would very much like to remember. Finally, after about 15 minutes, I calmed down, and decided it would be best to sleep. 

The following dreams were extremely real, even for me, and even now I am having problems discerning what happened in those dreams from reality. Much later on that day, a friend and I tried some, and he experienced the exact same effects of being forced upon by an external force, and hallucinating in another dimension. I smoked half a bowl, and again felt the push, but kept my eyes closed. Still a little shell-shocked from before, I was unable to release my firm grip on reality. I still felt the other dimensional pull, but as I was relaxed and under control, I laughed and had a great time. About 40 minutes later, we both felt energized and were in good humor. We continued to receive some audio hallucinations for some time, and sitting here typing this, I am still hearing shit constantly (I just heard an owl hoot from the corner of my room, and keep hearing footsteps.) We smoked at 11:00 PM, and now its about 5:00 AM. Maybe I am just freaking my self out, but I know I didn't just imagine that owl. 

Overall, I learned I was not respecting the plant and its powers. It is EXTREMELY powerful and COMPLETELY unlike anything you have ever experienced. If you are not prepared for that, you will panic like me. My second trip was much more enjoyable because I remained calm and respected the power of the plant. I advise all new users to start very very slow, and have no expectations. Your first few times will take awhile for the Salvia's effects to set in -- so don't powerpuff  (trust me) -- and become comfortable with your profound experiences. Also, have a tape recorder and someone there who is sober, every time! Make no exceptions, if you do you will learn. This isn't something to be taken half-assed, or by anyone not fully mature and respectful. Two major questions I have right now (I am a philosophy major) are being able to experience this very strange 4th dimension, and the name of the woman and what I said to her. For some reason that feels very important to me. I am firmly convinced of the power and greatness of this plants spirit. Respect it!










The complete story would fill volumes, and it has a need to be told, both to let others know of a dimension that exists in which all of our questions are answered, in which life's mysteries can be revealed, where God and Soul make absolute sense, and in which truth and madness are the same universe.  But this tale is a warning, not an advertisement, and should those who read it decide to explore the world that I have come to know as 'Gascid', beware to the extreme - not only of Gascid, but more specifically of Nitrous.  It is not the innocuous instrument of enlightenment that it may seem.

My brother coined the term 'Gascid' to describe the combination of Nitrous Oxide on top of LSD, although I believe that I may well have been the first to have discovered it - and if not I am certainly one of the most experienced.  I have done over 1500 doses of LSD over the last 20 years and of those, about 300 were done in combination with Nitrous oxide.  I read an article here 'Smeared Across Infinity' and inside surged with empathy for the fortunate voyager who experienced this psychedelic synergy.

To me, Gascid is a 'place', not a drug combination.  It would take a novel to explain a single experience.  I do not want to write 300 novels.  Gascid is quite simply the most profound experience that there is.  For me, it *is* truth - or was - I no longer do it (although I remember everything).  Because of it, I am no longer who I was, and will never again be 'normal' in any way, for which I am eternally grateful.  While I would like to write on the subjective experiences and journeys that I have undertaken, the things that I have seen and experienced and the understanding of everything that has come out of those experiences, this writing is not about Gascid, but about Nitrous Oxide and the dangers involved in its abuse.

For the moment, let us put the wonders of Gascid aside, because Gascid was never a problem for me (although most 'normal' people would consider me completely insane, something I also care little about), but at one point Nitrous Oxide became one, and now, seven years later, I still suffer from the effects of that problem.

For reasons that are unimportant for the telling of this tale, I slipped from moderate Gascid use to using Nitrous by itself.  I have now read a few articles by people who travelled down that slippery slope and thank the spirits that I am not alone in my foolishness and suffering.

A time came where I began to use Nitrous for more than than my Gascid experiments.  I was using 'whippits' as my source of Nitrous which complicated matters financially and nearly destroyed my marriage.  I cannot remember the exact point at which I crossed over from being a psychedelic explorer and scientist to Nitrous addict, but it was marked by the fact that I began using Nitrous without LSD.  It escalated to a point where I was using it daily.  The 'addiction', of which I was totally unaware as even being potential, kicked in so violently and instantaneously took me completely by surprise.  This was before the Internet, and I believed that my 'problem' was unique.  I had nowhere to turn, no-one to trust for fear of what they would think of me.  So I continued using Nitrous dialy.  I was a musician by profession and I ended up not going to gigs as I was too hung up on Nitrous or felt too horrible to go.  I was still under the impression that as long as you took breaks and breathed air for a while, you would be fine.  

What I did not realize is that the effects of chronic nitrous use are cumulative.  Hypoxia is a reality and I was slowly killing myself by degrees.  I knew that I was in trouble, but I carried on.  I simply could not stop, even though I felt/knew deep down that I was doing irreparable damage to myself.

Finally, at a gig, taking hits of Nitrous between sets, the tips of my fingers went numb.  Within a week I was in a neurological ward.  I had lost all physical sensation other than tingling and numbness.  I had lost all motor control and could no longer pick up a cup, let alone play a musical instrument.  An MRI showed that I had suffered serious demylination of the nerves in my neck (and ultimately throughout my entire nervous sytem).  I had suffered brain damage.  I have never fully recovered.

I cannot even begin to describe the horror that was the next year of my life.  Every time I bent my neck I experienced electric 'shocks' throughout my body.  The physical 'withdrawal' (in junkie terms) lasted three months - every moment of every day.  Then the shocks were replaced by pain, chronic, intense, neverending, for years and years and years.  Naturally I could never tell physicians the truth and because my life was not in danger per se, I was not allowed access to pain killers.  There was no treatment.

I have survived.  I am still alive.  I have two kids now who fill a lot of my void. I still live with permanent discomfort, but over the years the condition has slowly improved to the point where I am no longer suicidal.  Perhaps in another seven years I will be completely healed.

Gascid is a gateway to to true perception.  Nitrous oxide can be worse than lethal.  Those of you that want to experiment, do so - it's why the drugs exists, but BEWARE - Nitrous Oxide is not harmless.  Be frugal, stay in control - never do it regularly - and if you *are* losing control, get help.  The result of abuse can be worse than death.







[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people.  Don't do it.]

This took place eight years ago, when I was 20 years old.  From the ages of 18-22 I took either mushrooms or LSD about once a week, and have tripped only 3 or 4 times since then.  It began at a field party full of college students, about 100 people, most of which were tripping.  I ingested 4-5 grams of mushrooms, and was having an absolutely wonderful time.  Often mushrooms would make me feel very unsure if the setting was wrong (surrounded by non-tripping people, or trapped indoors in a claustrophobic environment).  

However, the vibes from the people were wonderful, and the beautiful night and large bon-fire all worked together to give an enlightening experience.  To me, that amount of shrooms was rather large, and my mind was definitely in another world.  But it was a beautiful world, as I was filled with a wonderful sense of inner-peace and joy that is somewhat indescribable with words.  Staring up at the sky, I felt at one with the universe and all of nature around me.  My mind was full of the deepest thoughts, and I could have sworn I had discovered the true meaning of life.  However, its times like these when the otherwise simple tasks become impossible, such as talking in a way that made sense to anyone but myself, or walking without thinking really hard about how to walk, or just simply functioning normally.  

I find it funny that many times previous to this I had bad experiences on shrooms on much smaller doses, as it all goes back to the fact that setting is everything.  I always felt that shrooms were best experienced outdoors, close to the trees and anything else nature oriented.  Also important is to be surrounded by like-minded people.  All of these things were present on this particular night, and my feelings were showing it.  

Unfortunately, things were about to take a very strange turn.  For a reason I cannot remember, as this was 8 years ago, my friend and I decided to leave.  This was out in the country, and we had about a 30 minute!
 drive back to my apartment in the city.  There was no traffic, and we were engaged in a conversation about how crazy it was that this substance was illegal, etc. etc. etc.  During those years I often sold marijuana, LSD, and mushrooms.  Since I did make alot of sales before the start of this party, we had in our posession many baggies containing 1-2 grams each of mushrooms, and about 25 hits of acid, and an ounce of pot divided in seperate bags.  I had never been in any trouble in my life, so I thought very little about getting busted.  I sold on a very small scale, and really only made enough to smoke free pot and take free mushrooms, and maybe some spending cash at the bar, as I was a poor college student.  Now back to the story.  We were quite oblivious to the world around us at this time, as we were peacefully enjoying this magical drive down the road.  I had a beer in my hand, and at this time the strange trip began.  

I swear on my life that all of this is 100% true, as I know it may sound somewhat unbelievable at times.  As I was taking a drink of my beer, I realized that out of nowhere (or so it seemed) there was I car to my right.  I glanced over and to my horror it was a cop.  I have no idea why he did this, but he pulled into a parking lot of some sort, and as we looked back we saw him pause and then start to come after us.  We had a quick moment as we went over a hill where we thought he could not see us, and we were grabbing all the little baggies of shrooms and I was quickly throwing everything out the window.  We thought we had gotten everything out.  

He followed us very closely for a mile or two, and then pulled us over.  We were now in a suburb area, and there was quickly 2 other patrol cars on the scene.  The first words from the cops mouth were 'did you guys really think I couldn't see you trying to throw beer cans out the window'  We were very happy to hear this.  As we stepped out of the car, they found about a 12 pack of beer, and on the floorboard a baggie containg a gram of shrooms.  A cop set it on top of the car, and announced to his fellow officers that we had a joint!!!  However, another cop came around and took a closer look, and announced that it was instead a 'stem and a cap'  They handcuffed us, and by this time I was really starting to freak out.  The lights of the cars were flashing everywhere, and it was a constant battle in my mind to try and deal with this forced reality.  My mind was unfortunately still in la-la land, thinking about what is infinite space and similar thoughts.  It was nearly impossible to keep cool.  I thought we were screwing up, but I guess we must have been acting ok.  

Before one cop reached into my pocket, he asked if I had any sharp objects which could cause him harm.  I replied 'not that I am aware of'  At the time I thought this was a perfectly reasonable answer, but he thought otherwise.  He demanded a yes or no answer.  I then said no, and all was well.  They put us in the patrol car and took us to the station.  We were then split up and put in seperate interrogation rooms.  

What happened now is strange.  We had no chance to discuss what we were going to say, but somehow we both said the same thing.  We said that at the party we used my friends car as the stereo, and many people we did not really know were going in and out putting in CD's to listen to.  Someone must have dropped it in the car.  They actually bought the story, as they figured we would not be stupid enough to get pulled over and leave drugs on the floorboard in plain sight.  They charged my friend with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, as he was 21 and there was beer in the car, and I was only 20.  They wrote out charges for posession of psillocybin(mushrooms), and said the charges and circumstances would be sent in and we may or may not be formally charged at a later date.  

The fact that we both said the same thing greatly aided our case.  During the interrogation, I was doing everything in the power of my mind to stay with the situation at hand.  The questioning cop was very close to my face, and the room was so small and incredibly light that his forehead appeared to be green, and at times I thought he seemed like a mere shell of a person, and not actually real.  After about 2 hours, they decided we were being honest enough and they let us go on a signature.  We called my friends girlfriend, and she came to pick us up as they had his car towed.  We then went back to where we threw out the drugs, and collected everything.  (We parked a ways away on a back road and approached from a different angle than the street.  

We were then sitting back at my apartment, smoking a joint, and realizing that the nightmare we had just gone throught was actually nothing more than a mere inconvenience to our trip.  We were never sent anything, and we were not ever charged in any way.  Even his contributing to the delinquency of a minor was never heard from again.  Needless to say, we never called to see why.  Getting arrested on mushrooms is definitely a strange trip indeed, far from the ideal setting.








My first experience with Salvia Divinorum was not a pleasant one, probably due to lack of preparation.  I was slightly hung over from the night before, and had slept too late into the day.  However, since I wouldn't have another hour alone in my house until two days later, I decided to go ahead and try smoking .5 grams of Salvia leaf.

The first thing that struck me was the harshness of the smoke.  (I don't smoke anything, except the occasional puff of quality cannabis).  After finishing almost all of the bowl, I began to experience visual effects.  A window I was looking at while I smoked seemed to bend, and warp.  I remember wondering at the time if it was due to holding my breath for so long, or Salvia, and decided that it was definately the herb.  

Upon finishing the smoke, I felt dizzy, and uncoordinated.  Similar, but not identical to the feeling produced by DXM intoxiacation.  My lungs felt uncomfortable, probably due to the fact that I seldom smoke anything.  I didn't experience any more visual effects, but there was a definite mental aspect which was indescribably different from LSD, Mushrooms, and any other entheogen I had previously used.

I slept some more, due to the lingering effects of my hangover, and experienced dreams laden with symblols which were meaningful to me, but which I cannot share due to their personal nature.  Salvia is a powerful drug, but I cannot recommend it as a recreational drug.  I plan to use it again, under better circumstances, but, in the future, I plan to chew the leaves.















It was anticipated to be the best party (rave) in a long time and the set and setting couldn't have been better, so I decided that this was the night I would trip for the first time (I had actually taken acid a month or so earlier but nothing happened more than a very slight body fry, very disappointed).  I also decided that I would do 2 hits this time to make sure I would actually trip - BAD idea (just a hint - never do 2 your first time!).

So within 30 to 45 minutes I was starting to feel quite energetic and everything was extremely funny - I was basically running around telling my friends I was crazy and insane, just because it was fun to say, and I was laughing my ass off at my friend A. as she did old 80's dances.  I went into the bathroom and my face stretched up and down in the mirror, I looked at the floor and I laughed in amazement as the tile swirled and shifted.  I came out and found my friend B, he said that 'metro is here' but to 'not worry about it, they're just making sure everything's OK.'  I thought little of this and proceeded to watch glowsticks, dance, laugh at funny shit, and basically have a great time.  Until the lights turned on.

(Mind you I took the acid at 10:30pm, it was now probably about 11:30)  At first I wasn't really bothered by the lights being on.  Cops were shutting it down (venue wasn't licensed, gee great).  I was in such a good mood and I knew I could keep my cool, thinking that as I stood right next to a cop.  But soon everything turned to confusion, everyone had to exit the building through a narrow hallway that seemed long as hell.  Everything in my trip at that point turned 'ghetto' as people started chanting 'fuck the police' and I began to get increasingly anxious and paranoid.  Peoples faces stretched and distorted and their eyes looked sunk in.  

Once outside I couldn't keep track of any of my friends if they were more than 10 feet away from me.  Extremely confused, halfway lost, and just trying to keep calm, A. walked me to my car and had me wait as she went to find a driver.  At this point I think is where I peaked, right before the cop came up to me, telling everyone to move out and go home. 

Before I knew it the cop was asking me who's car it was, (I said mine) asked if I could drive, (stupid me, I said no) then the horror started as he began asking what I took, if it was GHB, Ecstasy, LSD, asking if I 'wanted to go to jail tonight,' etc.  Everytime he asked, he made me look at him to answer, and everytime I looked it scared the shit out of me as his face morphed and stretched with an authoritative evil.  I knew he could tell I was lying, seeing how I kept looking away.  I scanned the parking lot as best I could for my friend A. who came up just in time and said told the cop that I had gotten 'dosed.'  I said yeah I drank some water that I had been dosed or something of that matter.

After what seemed like hours the cop believed that I had been dosed with some kind of drug involuntarily, took my pulse, which he said was around 140-160 bpm (because I was so intensely scared) and escorted me to sit me down by the ambulance.  The next 15 minutes I sat scared as hell asking for water, not being able to understand anything, still thinking I was in deep shit and my I was going to jail and my dreams and goals would never be reached.  I was so afraid I felt like crying (and I hardly ever cry) but I couldn't feel anything, no emotions, just fear and confusion.  They found me a cell-phone to use, I tried calling my friend V., she wasn't home.  Nobody was home.  Hell I even tried calling my dad and he would've been pissed, because all I wanted to do was go home where it was safe.

The rest of the trip was pretty much driving around all night in a passenger seat trying to locate other friends around town; it took me a good 2 or 3 hours for me to actually calm down once the cops let me go, I kept thinking that I was going to get caught if we got pulled over.

What I learned from this is to FUCKING MAKE SURE your setting is safe before doing any kind of drug, and to make sure you can handle it (and not to mention don't drive your own car to the party).  I wasn't ready for what happened that night and I don't think I could go through it again.  I'm eternally grateful to my friend A. for 'saving' me because had she not been there and had not come up at the right time with the right thing to say, I would've gotten hauled off and my future would be seriously fucked. 







6 friends and I were hanging out in a house all day taking Ex and GHB. We had all been out at clubs the night before together doing the same drugs (since approx. 3:am) cocaine was also used by some of the people. 

One person joined us around 5p.m. and seemed sober. He took 2 double stacked Red Toyotas and about an hour later a cap of GHB. Within an hour he took another cap. For approx. 1 hr. he was alone and unknown if he'd done more GHB (he told us later he'd done one more cap) at about 5p.m. someone noticed him slapping at his face and kicking his legs. He was violent and unresponsive, and began kicking and flailing around violently and babbling sometimes recognisable words (like: No! Go! Leave! etc, but mostly groaning and grunting). Two people tried to contain him but it made him react worse. He ran into a corner of the room and began banging his head on a cement wall and cut his skin pretty bad. After being restrained for a few minutes he managed to get away and ran to another room which was empty and fell on the floor and lay there kicking and slapping and making noise. 

After about 10-15 min of this 'siezure' he was frozen and completely unresponsive. Breathing seemed normal although slightly erratic and he would sometimes twitch. After about 3-4 hours he was awake and coherent. He didn't remember anything since sitting alone in the room before the seizure. His head was in pain but it was unknown if from the drug or the injury from the wall. It was found out later by another friend that this same person had a similar expirience earlier (about 3 or 4am) in a car coming from a different party and had been doing just GHB at that point. He didn't remember that had happened, he thought he'd just fallen asleep on the way home.








This account is the first of who-knows how many to come, a path that has led us to question much of what we thought reality to be.  It was an accident really, that propelled us into what has been a journey and a dream concerning our lives, and how they are connected.  

We took the long way to the farm on account of vague directions and even vaguer attention.  Farmer wanted us to camp with him, but we only planned to go out for the evening.  

We took a walk around the farm just after our arrival.  Farmer handed Jim and I what appeared to be an abused fig-newton.  It was his candy, he said.  It was figs and raisins and dates and extracted THC, the psychoactive in Cannabis.  Farmers candy is made with what is still a closely guarded recipe.  He told us wed be staying the night and we nodded-  we planned on leaving late.  Little did we know that Farmer was right.  I had had some prior experience with smoking Cannabis, and the experimentation every high school student has with alcohol.  I didnt think Jim had experience with anything, but he took the candy without seeming hesitation.  They werent horrible but they wouldnt sell on taste alone either.  

After our walk I began to notice subtle shifts in attention span and depth of field.  I felt as though I was speaking from far away.  I remember asking Jim a question and then wondering if I had spoken at all.  He said he felt nothing.  My attention would drift without notice, and then when I became aware of it, I was unsure of how long I had been gone.  My focus seemed to lock onto isolated quadrants, i.e. the plants directly around my feet as we walked, or a tree on the far bank, a spot on the water where the light flashed, etc.  Everything else was perfectly visible, but like a camera with a shallow field of focus, one area was observed with perfect clarity.  

Jim went off to do some thinking and meditate.  Farmer said Jim was high, although I couldnt tell.  Ten minutes ago I had been laughing in hysterics, and now I had become very foggy, worrying that I would lose track of the young dog I had brought along, despite how close she stayed all night.  

Farmer alerted me to Jim, now sitting some distance off staring out over the fields.  I told Farmer that Jim was practicing a Zen meditation.  Farmer found this particularly amusing.  I was unsure.  I was beginning to feel the first wave of a paranoia that gripped both Jim and I that night.  If you like the candy, beware kids, whatevers inside  is coming out!  I worked on it for a few moments and got it under control, riding the wave and paddling up to meet the next one.  We faced five or six of these waves of paranoia over something or other.  Each one seemed weaker than the previous.  Farmer was there as the voice of experience, and experience has taught this psychonaut that its always good to have a Tripmaster;  someone who has enough experience to go along with you for the journey, as well as cope with the real world if necessary.  That voice of experience was needed when Jim came rushing back into camp.  

I saw him running from a long way off and he seemed to take longer than I expected to arrive.  Not only depth perception was affected but perception of time as well.  What we thought to be an hour was fifteen minutes, six hours only two.  I was lying beside the camp-fire when Jim finally arrived.  

When I first began to trip on the candy I took every opportunity to go pee and try and clear my head.  I kept wondering that if we had knowingly and willingly induced this state of mind that was euphoric and fearsome at the same time, then why did the mind seem to constantly try to reassert itself to its standard frame of awareness?  I remember thinking at the time that these could not be higher states of consciousness then, but lower, more primal states.  After a good many other trips and conversations with mushrooms later on, I changed my mind.  I think what we experienced that night on our initiation was resistance.  We go after an experience sometimes with a preconceived notion of what we will receive, when the truth is, we can only accept what we are given and transform it into what we needed all the long.  

When Jim finally reached the camp he was frantic. He was dying, overdosing.  He was having an anxiety attack.  His heart was beating furiously and he couldnt breathe.  I wanted to tell him it was simply a rush, that my heart was pounding too, but my words seemed to come from a long way off and never made it past my lips.  Farmer tried to reassure Jim that everything was alright, but this was Jims first experience with anything this strong, and he was not to be immediately calmed.  

A lost tourist pulled up just then, and things got a little sticky.  Jim felt he was receiving no help from our group so he rushed up to the car window of the man and asked him to take him to the hospital.  Farmer, the Tripmaster, shooed Jim back toward the camp and got rid of the tourist, giving them directions and explaining that Jim was a newly diagnosed diabetic, and had forgotten his insulin.  We would have to ride into town to get some from a local pharmacy.  For one moment or two I thought we were going to spend the night or more in jail in Iowa!  

Farmer talked Jim down and then took us for a walk.  Jim rode that first big wave of paranoia and then began to see a point of clarity that he could operate from, and we began to talk and sort out what we were feeling and thinking.  The waves seemed to stem from deep-seated fears or traumatizing events.  These were new stretches of the horizon for Jim, and to rush into it with little or no introduction, and to such depths I cannot imagine.  I tease him about it still, but never belittle.  

I remember Jim handing me his soda bottle, asking me to hold it because he didnt trust himself with it.  I was barely able to hold onto my own, but took it out of reflex, painfully aware of the icy cold.  I didnt know Farmer very well at the time and at one time a distrust of him arose in me.  It stemmed from the vulnerability factor, and not trusting myself this time, I placed my pocket knife in the car, only to retrieve it moments later in case I needed it.  None of our fears were justified.  

Periodically riverboats passed lit for the night now, and Farmer seemed to lose his mind whenever one passed us.  He would leap out of his chair and run to the bank, once screaming at the Queen of Iowa.  Hey!  Can you hear me?!  He loved the moon, the riverboats, the sacred circle he believed we sat in, and the people who lived here before us.  Farmer would prove out to be a kind of mad mentor to us, a friend and gentle conspirator.  He was Wendell Berrys Mad Farmer  with a shamans rattle.  Thanks Farmer, for everything.  

We slept in the car toward the end of the evening.  Sleep was fitful, and when we did leave the next morning we were not entirely clear of the effects.  My attention drifted on the ride home.  Once, we came to wonder how we had arrived on the top of some grassy hill, and had to turn around and find our foggy way back.  Even after a nights sleep I was still foggy from the experience.  I worked at night and sometime around six in the morning I knew I was clear.  That would make the total run time about thirty-one hours of various states of altered consciousness, with the core intensity about six or seven hours.  

I called Jim and we got together for a long walk and talk.  He decided never to place himself in these states again.  I felt somewhat the same on the tail end, but the more time that flowed between myself and the experience, I saw that I was more and more apt to experience and experiment again.  Did we gain anything from that experience?   I think so.  We faced our deepest fears, the ones we pack around with us on a daily basis, and we came through to the other side.  Like good travel, one always goes far from home, only to wish for our own bed again.  And once home we begin to think back and long for foreign dust on our shoes once more.  

This experience was had at a small, isolated farm just outside of a major city in Iowa.  Jim is still pursuing his spiritual and intellectual curiosities, as am I.  Farmer is still Farmer, and as far as Im concerned thats a good thing.  I am planning to write more of these chapters, experimenting with LSA, Stropharia Cubenis, Mescaline, and Syrian Rue.  I would encourage any potential or fledgling psychonauts out there to listen carefully to your heart, research like a scholar, and experience ecstatically.











This is an account of what was the worst trip of my life. I went to a rave with a friend. On the line to get in, we were chatting with this kid from Ohio who had geltabs for sale. I indicated that I wanted to purchase, but should wait until we get inside. After we got in, I found my new friend and paid him for two black gels. This kid wasn't very slick, he sat down in a corner and took out a rather large sheet of geltabs. Having never taken geltabs before, but having used paper 9-10 times, I thought that I could handle two. All of a sudden, a cop started walking straight in our direction.  The dealer, who was tripping freakin' nuts, rips a good amount of that sheet and shoves it in my hands. I immediately threw it into my mouth and swallowed it. 

After about 20 minutes, it started coming in heavy. REAL heavy. I went to the chill area to eat a pretzel and drink an iced tea. I couldn't swallow the pretzel and would spit it out into my hand. I was then talking to this guy from NYC named Vic, who asked me how much acid I took. I said that I probably took about 9 or 10 doses at once, and that I was freaking out hard.

After that, I went to the stands and had a seat, eating a giant pixy stick and smoking a cigarette, because I was tripping far too hard to be dancing or anything. I then blacked out.

The next few hours are a muddle...I don't remember much other than screaming 'Kill me' to the nurses, taking a leak, or knocking over some no doubt expensive piece of machinery.

It turns out they had to sedate me.

I awoke the next day still tripping. This time is still a muddle...I don't remember much because it was so fucking wierd and beyond my comprehension. I don't know whether I was dreaming or conscious. I stared at my hands for what seemed like hours, and the doctors and nurses made fun of me. 

Next memory was me awakening in a different room a completely changed person. I could tell.  My mom had to drive an hour and a half in late June to come pick me up from the hospital. I have never seen her so angry in my entire life.

The Tuesday after, I had appendicitis and went to the hospital, where I stayed until Friday.

The flashbacks never stopped until about two months after that bad experience. Everything triggered them, from just staring at my hands in a certain way to hearing certain phrases.

I will never take acid again, and I am glad for this. I was (and still am, after five months of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication), at least a little, cut off from reality.

The moral of this story is to ALWAYS look at what you buy before shoving it in your mouth.

peace.....







First and foremost, I would like to say that I don't usually tell people this. They tend to think I'm a little off my rocker if I do. First a little background information for you. I started doing 'Special K' back in 1993 at Rave parties. I would sniff a twenty or two when I was coming down from my Ecstasy. We liked it because it made you feel like you were peaking all over again. It was fun and the thing to do at the time.

Now the thing that I'm really writing this about is not how fucked up I used to get but a certain level it took me to. I really believe that when you are on 'K' you can communicate with other species, specifically CATS. I'm not saying that I had intelligent conversations with a cat. I believe that I communicated with them in ways that just aren't normal.

So with that in mind I will tell you why I believe this. I had gone to a party in Richmond at a friend's house. We decided to see what would happen if we pushed the limit with Ketamine. I had a pretty high tolerance so instead of the usual 150mg I loaded up three syringes full at 100mg's each. I had two of them and my friend had the other one. On the count of three we simultaneously injected all three into me. Two in my legs, one in my arm. 

Now I'm not going to bore you with the initial feelings and the colors (which were great, by the way). I remember that I definitely wanted to go outside because of the weather. I ended up in your basic dirty, trash-filled back alley.

At this point I felt like I was dreaming, as though I was slipping in and out of reality. At the same time I also felt like I had control of the situation.

I saw a cat running at the end of the alley. I knelt down and called to it and I knew inside that it would come. It came directly to me. Now I know that this sounds completely normal. You are probably thinking that the cat must have been someone's pet. That is what I would probably think too. It isn't that odd for a cat to get lost from it's home. It could just look like an alley cat, dirty and hungry. But the thing is, other cats started approaching. I called all of them over to me and they came. All of them were loners. Quite honestly I really don't believe that five or six cats, that were lost from their homes, all lived in that alley together.

They were dirty, hungry, wild looking animals. If you don't know about alley cats, pretty much about 99.9% of the time, they run like bats out of hell at the sight of a human being.

I remember that I wanted to shield and protect them from their lives. I think that because of the Ketamine my mind was opened to a level of connection and understanding. I felt as though I could feel their fear and their pain and they could feel my empathy. I petted them and talked to them for how long I don't know.

My friend who was looking for me turned the corner and the cats disappeared into the hiding places they called home. At first I thought I must have hallucinated the whole thing because it was just to incredible. But thanks to my friend, I had an eye witness. He told me that he saw me sitting Indian style with a bunch of cats milling around me and he saw them take off when he got closer.

I remember that I was just in total awe. I felt so connected with a bigger picture. Also, it was like a dream come true. When I was a little girl I used to pretend that I could communicate with animals. It happened with the help of Ketamine.

When I tell people about this, they pretty much agree that it could happen, but don't really believe in it. My friend who found me believes in this higher level. Sometimes it's hard for me to believe that six alley cats came to me at one time, but it happened. It was not a dream.

Anyway, that was one of my many experiences on Ketamine. It was the best and by far the most memorable.










Yeah, I'm starting to think that wild shroom trip of late last year was the result of having an empty stomach.  A friend and I dosed in the car before going to a special goth night.  He ate ~3 grams, I eyeballed my dose so it could have been more.  Brown caps, blue and beige stems.

About 20 minutes in I noticed some effects.  A gut-feeling, some excitement.  I joined my friend in the back -- he was feeling it too, but he wanted a cigarette.  I suggested we take a walk (read: he smoke it outside), but nothing doing.  The thought of tobacco smoke at that point was sickening me, so I walked to the front room.

Basically, the peak lasted about 30 seconds -- I sat down in a less crowded/hot area of the club, I felt like I was reeling, and then my entire field of vision was overlaid with little lower-case S's -- a shuddering, intense hallucination.  I staggered to the bathroom, thinking I might (or might want to) vomit.

I knelt down by the toilet, which, in a place like that, would normally make me puke anyway, but then my head cleared.  I stood up, realized that the peak was over, and went back to where I was sitting.  I no longer needed to take a walk outside or anything -- I couldn't talk much, but I could stare at people, which is half the point at this place anyway.  My point is, I usually don't notice a peak on shrooms. 

Later, the back room cleared out and fans ventilated it.  There was room to dance without contact, which was great considering how startling it was sometimes when someone touched me.  I danced and smiled like an idiot, realizing that everyone else was dancing goofier than me, and that, even if I cared, no one would pick me out as the one on drugs.  I had a nice friendly, not-even-that-disjointed conversation with the woman who sat down next to me.

Mushrooms make me very excited about dancing if the music is right, without interfering with my sense of balance or rhythm (this from my purely subjective POV).  My sense of comfort increased to the point where I thought I was having the most fun ever -- I couldn't imagine not doing this all the damn time, both the gothing and the shrooms.

My thoughts were very circular and repetitive -- which can be tedious to bad on LSD, but seemed fine in this context.  I thought about the sexual frustration that comes with only using alcohol at clubs.  I realized that without the futile expectation of nookie, I could have fun and still appreciate the people around me in terms of attractiveness, i.e., looking, not leering.

The circle of thoughts got more profound -- I started thinking about happiness, and life in general, how the only way to be happy was to feel happy, and that this was completely under my control, how I felt.  I got a sense of satori, a feeling of enlightenment that comes from ending up in the same place you started.  Then I giggled at me thinking that I was being so deep.  Heh.

I could preface this whole report with, 'Maybe it was just the drugs, but I had a great time!' but it could just as easily have been the case that, 'Maybe it was just the drugs, but that place was terrifying and sucked.'  The facts are, the drugs and the venue went well together.  The lights were turned down (they shut off the normally blinding light guns, that or made them a dim color), there was plenty of room to sit and dance, I was on the list and got in for free, and the staff and patrons I encountered were very friendly.  We stuck around 'til closing (I was also trying to get a cut on my finger to close -- don't fish chunks of glass out of a drain while you're tripping, kids).








First of all I would like to say that I am an advocate of GHB and it's relatives (GBL 1'4 BD); I have used GHB for over 3 yrs with great benefit to my health, social life, and overall well being. However there does seems to be an issue of addiction and withdrawl from GHB which is causing some confusion which I hope to help clarify. 

First, GHB is not addictive in the classic sense. The body doesn't react to a lack of GHB in the brain. GHB addiction is at first psychological. Everyone likes to feel good. The fact that GHB has such a lack of toxic effects on the body allows for the user to abuse it in a way you couldn't do with almost any other drug without ill effects. This often leads multiple dose use throughout the day. I myself found I could consume nearly 15-20 grams throughout the day, and I have found many with similar habits.
 
GHB's 'buzz' is caused by the action of neurotransmitters Seratonin and GABA, the levels of these two transmitters is increased due to the fact that GHB blocks the release of dopamine. Although dopamine release is blocked the product of dopamine is not. This means when the GHB wears off a dopamine rebound occurs. This is the energized feeling most expirence as the GHB wears off, also responsible for waking in the night when a larger dose is used. When GHB is used in multiple doses over weeks, monthes, and even years an excessive amount of dopamine is stored in the brain. If the user then attempts to stop GHB use this dopamine floods the brain causing numerous effects which could be catergorized as withdrawl. The most common (and the ones I myself experienced) are Insomnia, shaking (of hands or limbs), Anxiety, Rapid heart-beat, sensations of hot and cold, general sensory over stimulation, and depression. 

The duration of these symptoms varys depending on the frequency, as well as duration of use. Tapering off GHB helps quite a bit. First lower your dosage, if you were taking a cap (2-2.5) grams every 2-3 hours cut to half a cap but in the same intervals. Then decrease the time between use. This will help but expect to experience a few sleepless nights if you're a heavy user. Benzos (valium, xanax) are extremely helpful if you have access. Most doctors will not have a problem perscribing them if you are displaying such withdrawl symptoms. I found .25mg of xanax 3 times daily to be sufficent. The best thing to do is never get in the situation of massive use to begin with. I now believe that GHB should not be used more then 5 days in a row without at least 24-48hrs off to allow from the dopamine to clear. Even this may be too excessive. I hope this is helpful to someone out there. Best of luck. Don't be afraid of medical attention, doctors are there to help.







i used this substance early in the new year as part of an attempt to redirect my not inconsiderable talents towards a more productive and spiritual path.

The effects were apparent 15-25 minutes after ingestion of the brew. I had some warnings about bowel tension and decided to eat a fair amount of peppermint after ingestion....... unfortunately i did not escape the wrath of mandrake and rode 'the bus' for a very uncomfortable 45 minutes before expelling a noxious and unproductive fart of some volume.

However, 1-2 hrs after this i had an incredible dream/hallucination involving the shadows cast by a violent storm outside. this is by far one of the most frightening and subtle drugs i have used... the only metaphor i can think of is that it is like an absolute opposite to morning glory tinctures which i often use in very small doses as a preparation for significant rituals.

If you are of celtic descent and interested in the darker side of your past i thoroughly recommend this substance .... with extreme caution.







My first experience with the Amanita muscaria mushroom was a really intense trip of the body and mind.  From the experience reports I had read, I wasn't expecting that much from this curious little mushroom, but I ended up getting more that I bargained for.  My two friends and I ordered some grade A+ mushrooms from the internet, and we received them a week later.  We ate the shrooms with salsa at 8pm one evening, and by 9pm we were feeling some of the effects.  There was a little nausea to begin with, but it subsided within 10 minutes, and a feeling of energy surged through my body.  

I walked into another room to smoke some pot, and it felt like I was walking on air.  I only took one hit, because I was feeling so good from the shrooms that I didn't need anything else.  I started to notice some definite alterations in perception.  I sat down with my fellow trippers to listen to some music.  While we were listening my friend pointed out to me that the patterns on the carpet were moving.  I looked down and I noticed it also.  By now, we were experiencing some really cool visuals.  The music seemed to make the room come alive.  Shapes and colors were dancing throughout.  I layed down and noticed that the ceiling was dripping with a clear blue substance.  I tried not to be hit with the drops as I lay on my bed.  My friend asked me whether or not I saw the waterfall running across the ceiling that he saw.  I told him what I was seeing, and that was the last conversation that we had for awhile.  

I let my mind take over, and I experienced one of the most intense psychological trips that I can remember.  It was like I was trapped in a series of dreams and every time I tried to come out of one, I would only get trapped in another.  They kept multiplying, and after awhile, I was trapped in thousands of dreams and I got the feeling that I may never wake up.  This fear subsided though, and I realized that I was just tripping.  That was the thing about these mushrooms, no matter how lost in your own world you got, you still always knew that it was just a trip and that it would end sometime.  I think that was the only thought that kept me from flipping out.  

Eventually, the drug started to wear off after about 5 hours.  It was 3am and I started to regain control of my thoughts.  I went to sleep, and I had some dreams that seemed eerily realistic.  I would recommend these mushrooms to everyone.  It was a really interesting experience that left me humbled by the power of one's own mind.









last night, i decided to take approx. 100 mg of 5meo diisopropyltryptamine, and there was NOTHING 'foxy' about it.  i wanted to do this for the same reason that evil Kinievel wanted to jump over the grand canyon on  his motercycle - because it was dangerous and it had never been done before.  i thought i could handle it.  i thought i had BIG balls - big enough to ride out even the the roughest trip.

i was wrong

it's now approx. 24 hours after i took the dose, and i feel like i just got back from three tours in viet-fuckin'-nam.  if it weren't for the twelve pack of old miliwalkie in my fridge, i would be in a mental institution now eating haldol and cubes of green jello.  there were two qualities to the experience that distinguished it from those of all other psychedelics:
1)  the effects were not especially visual or auditory, even with 100mg.
2)the experience was redundant - the trip had not one peak, but two.  it was as if i had divided the dose and taken the two halves several hours apart.

the 'trip' such as it were, kicked in about 60 minutes after i ingested the drug.  for the first fifteen minutes, all the effects were a reflection of it's aphrodesiac properties; i noticed the sex in everytthing.  the shows on my telivision, the songs on my radio and Cd player, myself.  i decided to get some workl done on the book im writhing.  what i've been looking for in a psychedelic is something creatively opening - something i can write with - so i put this 'foxy' stuff to the test.  writing new text was out of the question, no ideas came to me.  but examining the esthetics of what i had already written seemed to come easily with this drug, so i did some proofreading.  it allowed me to read the story as if i were someone else - a total stranger - and in this state, i could ask: 'does this read well' 'is it entertaining' i think fiction writers could benifit from doses in the neighborhood of fifteen mg.

then the trip really took off..  not visually, but emotionally.  over the course of the next thirty minutes a entered a realm of sheer terror.  no visual hallucinations, little in the way of auditory distortions, just a slowly mounting feeling of terror.  i started out feeling like lust, like libido, but that feeling was qwuickly swallowed up by the fear.   everything i saw, everything i heard, came to me as waves of fear.  all the panic switches in my mind were suddenly flipped on.  color and sound were still unnaffected, but these scare waves that poured through me aquired a kind of pattern, like some kind of metaphysical morse code.  a presence was speaking to me in waves of fear.  the message was something like.  'i will let you live for one reason and one reason alone , so you can tell the others NEVER to come here.  i could tell i was in a very empty morphic field (but for the presence) and this lent further credence to the notion that a had taken a higher dose of this drug than any other human being ever has.

i was in a world of shit.  i raced to the fridge and pulled out a 12 box of old milwalkieand returned to the couch with it.  i turned off the TV, because at this point all sensory input had taken the form of fear, so the less input there was, the better.  i put the beer next to the phone, and weighed my options:  option one.  dial nine eleven and summon the cops.  they would take me to an institutuion and give me drugs that would shut down my dopamine receptors and mask the fear. (and turn me into a quivering, drooling retard.)  in addition the press would probably have a feild day with this, and 5meo-dipt would probably become a shcedule one controlled substance.

i didn't want to be responsible for ruining everybody's fun, so i went with option number two - alchohol.  it was the closest thing i had to an anti-psychotic drug, so i killed two beers.  the terror was still there and still building, so i killed two more.  it took me six beers to get me drunk enough not to ignore the feeling of sheer panic within me.

over the next hour, the fear levelled off.  i felt like i was at baseline again.  i got up and walked around, made something to eat, and just generally wsent on with my life, but what i didn't know then was that this was just the eye of the storm. i kicked back on my couch, having eaten my supper, and leaned forward to pick up the bottle of melatonin (another tryptamine) from the coffee table.  i hesitated, just before i wrapped my fingers around the bottle;  another wave of fear blew through me.  'No.' i said.  'this isn't fair.  i did the trip, i payed my dues, it's over!'

but it wasn't.

for the next two and a half hours, i re-experienced the effects of the drug - the panic, the fear, the conspicuous lack of visual enhancement.  the terror mounted again, to the point that it bacame intolerable.  i had six beers left, and i drank them all.  thius time, the ethanol wasn't enough to drown out the  ferar - it was still there, and so was the presence, speaking to me in fear code:  'where do you think you're going?!' it asked  'I'm not done with you!'  for the next two hours, this creature proceded to bounce me off every wall in the universe

four hours later (well after sunrise) i was totally burned out, and a great deal wiser.  i hope this experience will serve as an educational one.  i thought i had big balls -  but they weren't THAT big.  thank you for your time. 






I decided to try Salvia divinorum after finding it on the web while researching herbal ecstacy and psychoactive herbs.  I looked at the various information sources on the web and decided this would be a good experiment. 

My gram of 5x extract arrived by express mail (on a Sunday, no less) and I was immediately excited to try it.  The vial of herb felt warm in my hand after I removed it from the package, and I had a sense of urgency, but I'm not sure if it was from me or the Salvia.  The extract was too minced to make a quid, and I didn't have a bowl, so I rolled a joint out of about 1/4 gram of the extract, put on some melodic trance music, and smoked it as well as I could.  The smoke was surprisingly smooth and easy to hold in; I could hold a lungful until I needed more air.  Immediately I felt a difference, kind of like a shifting to a different world of some kind.  There was a tingling senstation running through the skin of my arms.  At this point there were also some faint visuals.  It was a very subtle change, like my senses were waking up to something new.

I laid back on my bed, listened to the music and relaxed in the shaded light of my room.  Slowly, I began to notice more sensations, like the faint trails my hand left as I waved it in front of my face, little patterns rippling through the ceiling, the music becoming fuller and more resonant within me.

Eventually, I felt warm, like I was being held tenderly.  A spark of electricity rode up my spine at this point.  My hair felt like someone was running her fingers through it.  By now my eyes were closed and I was just enjoying the sensation of being cuddled.  It was as if Maria (the Salvia) was giving me the tenderness and love I needed at that point.  I was very touched.  Throughout this, I had the sensation of being surrounded by vines and leaves, and there was a very 'green' feel to the experience.  She didn't want to talk much, just relax on a Sunday afternoon.  It was somewhere between being held by a lover and being a cat held on someone's lap.

After about an hour, the effects wore off substantially, and the presence was almost gone.  I stretched, rolled around in my bed, got up, thanked Maria again, and buried the ashes in the back yard, as an impulse that may have been her request (it felt like it was).  I felt quite mellow and rather pleasant.

It's about two hours later, and there are still some lingering effects as I'm typing.  I feel much less disconnected than I felt earlier, and much more balanced.  This was definitely a good experience, and I'm looking forward to experiencing it again, with perhaps a larger dose.  There may be more to this experience than meets the 'eye'.







[Warning: Coricidin Cough and Cold contains CPM (Chlorpheniramine Maleate) which is dangerous in high doses.  See DXM Brand Warnings for more info.]

Well, I've taken Coricidin pills before and everything was good, i didn't have any visuals but it was a really fun and exciting high. that was only from taking 8 or 9 pills. but the other night some friends and i were at a party of a friend and we all took 16 pills. My experience was horrible.

At first i was okay, nothing was too bad, but out of nowhere i had to vomit so i did. i thought i was fine after that, but then like 3 minutes later i had to vomit again and i couldnt stop. i was in this guys bathroom puking my guts out. nasty nasty nasty. 

After id puked out all i could, i just layed on the floor of this dudes bathroom tripping out. the guy was nice and gave me blankets and shit so i'd be comfortable but i was still nauseus and felt sick as hell. i stayed laying on his floor for a long ass time, freaking out, seeing shit. i KNEW that i was going to die that night and i was scared. my death was sitting on the floor with me all night, when i say my death i dont mean anything like the grim reaper or some monster, it was just a shadowy figure of myself, it didnt look like me, but i knew somehow that it was me and it was my death. 

People tried to get me to leave the bathroom and come join the party, but i didnt want to leave my death because i didnt want it to get mad at me and kill me so i stayed until this kids dad came home and kicked us out. i only left my death at that point because i thought he/she/it had calmed down and wouldnt kill me anymore if i left him/her/it. 

People who asked me why i wouldnt leave thought i was insane when i said that if i left it would kill me. and i didnt want to upset my death by telling people about it while it was still not too calm, so they would ask me who was trying to kill me and id just say 'its going to kill me'. i layed there for a long time seeig things and trying to talk, but nothing would come out. it was really strange. and i heard people talking in the other room about me and i screamed 'im in here dont leave!' they came in and were like 'how the fuck did you hear us?' because they were on the total opposite side of the basement whispering so i wouldnt hear them, but through hightened awareness i did. weird shit.

Anyway, a friend of ours drove me my and my two friends to their house (they r sisters) and we stayed in one of their rooms the whole night. i thought they'd gone insane and id gone insane and we'd be locked in the room insane together forever. we just sat there talking and it was crazy. even when we woke up the next morning we were still kind of nuts. this was only yesterday and i still feel kind of nuts. im not tripping anymore, but i still feel weird and spacey a lot of the time. 

My suggestion is DO NOT USE CORICIDIN EVER!!!!!! its horrible. i think ill try other forms of dxm but never again will i face my death with Coricidin.  Use anything but Coricidin if you'd like to live.










I've roboed seven or eight times so far, with each experience being slightly different from all of the rest. Lately, however, things have started to change (for the better!), as I've been studying and experimenting with various out-of-body states (while I'm sober). Additionally, I've been experimenting with alpha/theta stimulation CD's that influence your body to fall asleep, while your mind stays alert. Last night, I ingested 661 mg of DXM, and the journey began. Here are the two 'key moments':

- While in a different state of existence (unlike physical reality), I began to summon every person that I've been in contact with throughout my entire life -- family, friends, enemies, people I've passed on the street, etc... It took a lot of mental effort, and quite a good deal of time before they were all present -- I could see each and every one them as a small glowing 'orb' of light; they all looked physically identical, yet somehow I knew who each one of the orbs was... I had an additional sense of perception -- I could look at any one of the orbs and I would immediately be flooded with that person's physical appearance, thoughts, feelings towards me, etc... Quite an overwhelming experience, considering how many people were present! Anyway, I decided that there was no way I could directly communicate with all of them, so I decided to 'emit' love and understanding to each and every person present, regardless of past disagreements or misunderstanding. A bright, golden light began pouring out of me and enveloped everyone who was present.

- Not too long after, I found myself traveling to a realm that I could sense was much 'higher' in significance than any of the other places that I had visited. I ended up in the middle of an endless mass of silver/golden light -- I could feel every single particle of my being disintegrating and becoming part of the light-mass; indescribable sensations bombarded every part of me -- far greater than any pleasure that I've experienced here on Earth.

All of these experiences were unlike any that I've ever had before. During my past robotrips, I always enjoyed myself, but all of my experiences were nothing more than hallucinations. As real as they seemed, I always knew that they weren't real. This time was -VERY- different; these experiences were as real as anything I've experienced in this life. As real as the cup of coffee sitting in front me. As real as the raindrops falling outside.

I could write for hours, detailing all of my experiences last night, but, unfortunately, there aren't many words that I can think of that would accurately describe such experiences! It's like trying to describe an emotion (love, jealousy, etc.), without using other emotions in such description.

I'm going to keep working very hard (without disassociates) on my out-of-body travel 'skills' for the next few weeks, and then I'll robotrip again and see how much farther I can go.

!!! Wow !!!







here's a little bit of background that pertains to my tale... my dabbling in perception altering substances have been few & rather far between, consisting of 6 MDMA experiences & one rather unsettling LSD trip.  i drink & smoke weed when the occasion permits, but not @ levels that seriously alter my reality.  the main thing to bear in mind, dear reader, is that prior to the story that is about to unfold, i was a very depressed individual.  i suffered from severe self esteem problems mostly centering around poor body image, & it had been interfering in my daily life for many years.  w/ the aid of this wonderful empathogen, i was able to permanently change the way i perceive myself & the world, & consequently have been far happier in my life since this occurred.   read on...
	
one night i had the wonderful good luck to run across 2 capsules of pure MDMA- 135 milligrams a piece of the good stuff, straight from the chemist, not cut w/ speed or anything else the way your average tablet of street E is.  the two friends (D & J)i was w/ that night decided that it would be a good time for them to roll for the first time (D had a capsule of the same stuff i did, & J had a tablet of street E that was known to be strong but speedy) i agreed to roll w/ them, & sort of babysit them through the experience.  in the past i'd never needed to take more than one tablet of E (approx. 125mgs of MDMA) to really feel it, so i thought that one of these capsules would work just fine.  i passed out a multivitamin to my trip companions because i've found the magnesium in them stops jaw clench & eye jitters, & the vitamin C is good for you =)  i took 400mg of advil for a headache, but i doubt that impacted my experience @ all.

9:30pm- down the hatch!  we all down our respective pills w/ a grin & set off for a friend's house to relax & wait for them to hit.

10:00- J's E hits him suddenly, rocketing him to the peak almost instantly... his eyes are jittering around from the speediness of his tablet, but he's in heaven playing w/ ice cubes & hugging.

10:30- D & i are ~barely~ feeling the twinges of the come on, but he's feeling it more than i am

10:45- D beginning to come up noticeably, i'm still not really feeling it, & grow suspicious; was i cheated by the dealer?  its NEVER taken this long for MDMA to affect me before!

11:00- i lose my patience & take the second capsule, wanting to be @ the same level as my companions.  

11:15ish- time sort of gets lost around here... the come up i was feeling keeps growing & growing, sort of like a psychedelic snowball rolling down a mountain!  i don't feel the sharp *peak* of street E, but rather this incredibly gentle but utterly irresistible wave of enhanced perception & sensation.  i feel briefly guilty as i realize that D & J, who i'm supposed to be caring for, are supporting me between them as my head rolls around on my shoulders... they're engaged in deep conversation while i'm past the ability to verbalize & instead just lost in the tactile aspect of the drug.  
	
i spend a good 3 hours floating in the grips of a ~VERY~ powerful plateau/peak, cuddling w/ my friends & silently absorbing their conversations, thrilled to know that they are getting something very meaningful out of this experience even if their 'trip-sitter' has melted into little more than a human pillow *grin*.  by the time i'm 'down' enough to talk, they're both on the sleepy part of their come-downs, & so just sit smiling as i jabber & laugh to them about all the things that have occurred to me during the roll.  after a lengthy & very uplifting conversation w/ them, we part ways & i return home, still WAY above baseline.  
	
@ home i catch a glimpse of myself in my mirror, & this catalyzes some reaction deep inside of me.  in my heightened state i see (for the first time) my own beauty!  trivial though it sounds, it was a mind shattering realization for me, considering in the past mirrors had literally brought me to tears.  in my previous experiences w/ MDMA i had always been struck w/ the exquisite beauty of my friends & surroundings, but i had never seen myself through that perceptual lens.  i spend a good 2 hours writing down my personal revelations about myself while looking into a mirror, giggling & smiling ear to ear in sheer delight!  
	
i finally fall asleep sometime before dawn, exhausted & ecstatic, & still nowhere near sober...
	
although my pupils had returned to their normal size (my pupils become EXTREMELY dilated while i'm under the influence of MDMA) & i wasn't feeling the physical 'roll' of the MDMA, i was still very affected by it until late afternoon/early evening the next day.  i was quiet & subdued, but in the same state of heightened empathy i usually only experience during the peak of a roll.  that night i finally returned to baseline, but w/ a wonderful feeling of peace w/ myself.
	
it has been over a week since this experience, & i still retain that wonderful sense of inner calm.  my reflection greets me w/ a sly, almost mischievous smile now instead of a disparaging look of disgust, & the world seems a little brighter.  i don't advocate looking for peace in a pill, & in fact i don't think that was where i ~really~ found it, but i do think everyone should be aware of the amazing effects that empathogens can have upon one's mind when the time is ripe for a change in how you view yourself & the world.  blessed be.










  It was my first time at a rave with my boyfriend and I had just turned 15. My boyfriend had gone to raves all the time and nothing bad had ever happened to him so I figured I would be fine. My boyfriend had got the capsules from the same supplier he always gets them from so I figured they were safe. At about 9:00p.m. we took the first capsule and I started having the best time of my life, I was dancing on tables with my shirt off in this sparkley bra while my boyfriend and I were freaking each other. It was the most indescribable experience. We made sure we always had water and I never got dehydrated. Then at 1:30a.m. I was off my high and I wanted to last the rest of the night so I thought I'd take my second pill. Then a couple minutes later we decided to go back and dance. about 5 minutes later the room started closeing in on me and I grabbed my boyfriend and we walked outside. Then I started drinking some water and from then on I don't remember anything. My boyfriend said we walked around forever and I was puking and puking all over the place. Then he said my whole body turned blue and all finds of ravers tried to help me throwing blankets and sweaters on me trying to keep me warm. Then he decided to take me back home and he said when we were in the parking lot I collaped and he started screaming for help. I went into seizures and I was foaming at the mouth and my eyes were rolled into the back of my head. Other people came to aid my boyfriend a girl put her finger in my mouth to keep me from choking on my tongue and the said I was just sleeping and that I'd wake up. Well I laid on my boyfriends bed from about 2:00 a.m. to 11:00a.m. and then at 11 he called my parents and told then that I wouldn't wake up. My parents thought I was drunk so they didn't come and get my till 9:00p.m. When my parents finally came and got me I was pretty much dead I wasn't breathing well on my own. I got to the hospitible and there I was in a coma for 3 days the doctors said if I did live I would be retarded. 
     
But anyway I learned my lesson and it's a miracle that I'm even alive.







Today was about my 5th experience with Salvia Divinorum. Might I say it was the most wonderful.

I have tried Salvia Before and had wonderful experiences,but they were in such a flash. A rush that it was a bit confusing. A few days ago I recieved my own cutting of Salvia. I've felt a connection with her.Its almost as If I can feel her spirit. I feel that is part of the reason that my most recent experience was as wonderful as it was..Ok :)

Total darkness, sitting in my room as I focused on the sound between the sound of nothingness. I was ready. As I smoked the first bowl I started to feel the familiar feeling of pressure starting at my feet and rising to my head. I held in the entire bowl in one Hard inhale. I held it in until I felt it was no longer possible. (I have found this to be one of the keys to discovering salvias wonderful light.) I was in her world.

I loaded the second bowl and after the first hit I was gone. The pressure became so tremendous that it pushed me out of my body. About the first 5 mins of the Salvia Trip had been somewhat the same each time. I feel the universe. I AM the universe and all that is within it. I begin to spiral downward. I become the galaxy, the earth, the land, the city, the house, my room, my wall, my floor, me. While on this journey I have no concept of comming or going. I dont know if I am, if I was, or if Im about to be.

I saw two beings of light. I became lost in the energy that surrounded me. I had no concept of a 'self.'I simply was. IT wasnt until my roomate walked past my room and spoke that I realized what I was doing. I was knocking everything off of my shelves and couldnt stop because I didnt know If I was doing it or if I was about to do it. It is an amazingly incredible experience.

I ran to my telephone and called a friend of mine to describe to her what was happening. Until that point the trip had been the same as the others but only a little stronger.

As I heard her voice,I closed my eyes. Within my minds eye..I saw a large screen. With every sound that she spoke I saw a wave of color. The wave moved according to the pith and length of the sound. As I became aware of what I saw, it went away. I started to remember what I had just experienced. The feeling of 'unity' with the universe is so wonderful. Its truly beyond any words that could come close to describing it. But it flashes by. Its similar to a roller coaster. Theres so much to experience and so little time. Imagine..experiencing the entire universe in 5 mins.

As I spoke to her the feelings began to rush through me again. I connected with my higher 'self'. I saw the true purpose of life. Before this lifetime, we ARE the universe. We know and experience All of every moment. Beyond the 'idea' of space and time. With that in mind this life is a part of that universe that is our (higher)self. So through the experiences of this life that is our (physical)self, We are discovering the deeper realms of our'higher'selves. In the higher realms there are no boundaries,we are simply everything,but we cannot percieve because we are. So within this lifetime we are given the gift of restriction. Our body..We can experience all that there is but with a sense. It is so important that we remember that this life is only a mere fraction of the entirety of eternity. Dont get lost in the physical,thats not why were here. But thats my experience. I dont know that I can explain much more of this experience with words,I can only hope that you will 'know' what it is I am trying to say.

Salvia Divinorum is one of the most wonderful things on this earth that I have ever experienced other than life itself. But not because its a wonderful drug, because its not. ITs not a drug at all. If you could imagine a life of blindness, never knowing the light of day. Salvia removes that blindness. She is not the light, but simply a means of helping us percieve it.

Please do not abuse this amazing plant.
She is here to help us learn.
We are nothing in her presence. She is the one taking us on the incredible journey. So treat her with respect and she will give it in return.







We left to the rave around 1-1:30AM and didn't arrive till 2:15AM or so. Completely and utterly sober, we entered the venue, ready to breakout with whatever the night held for us. Immediately two friends were put on 'Roll Patrol' and went off searching for our dose of the commercially named 'ravers drug', Ecstacy. In the mean time, a few friends and myself proceeded to mingle through the dance floor, sliding through the crowd with slick motion, as to not disturb anyone already in a trance, till we found 'our' spot for the night. Then the focus on the music came and most other things became irrlevent once again and I let the music take me. Every so often I was broke out of this trance, but at this time it was my friend back with my roll. Unaware of what kind the pill was, I put it into my mouth, swallowed and continued my movement.
     
We left the venue early that night, we had come across quite a few other party goers that we had known from a few instances before and invited them back to my friends house to chill the night away with us and the gladly accepted the invitation. Once I got back into the van that we had driven there, it started. I started feeling weird, not like my heart was going to explode, or that there was something physically wrong with me, but I got the bad vibe. The vibe that you get when you are in a situation that you know is wrong, everything around you is wrong, you shouldn't be here, you should be somewhere else. I couldn't understand why I got this vibe, because I was around all my friends, everyone was smiling, no one felt this way but me, so I kept it to myself for the ride back to his house.
     
As I got out of the van in the driveway at home, my girlfriend, who was rolling for her first time, ran up to me and gave me a big hug and looked at me and asked what was wrong. All I replied was that something was wrong and I was going to lay down and she should go downstairs with the others. I didn't want my bad roll to affect hers, I have had many many enlightening experiences while on Ecstacy and I didn't want my bad one to make hers a bad one, becuase I thought she was enjoying herself quite a bit.
     
We walked inside and I made my way past the people standing in the entrance way to my friends bedroom where I figured I'd lay awake for a lil' while chillin and slowly drift off to sleep as the roll wore off. But instead she came with me.
     
At that point I was so afraid that I was freaking her out about me and that I was causing her to have a bad roll that I almost didn't want her in the room with me. I'm glad she stayed. I didn't move, but for a brief ride, out of that bed for the rest of the night. It was so amazing. Being there with her at that moment just blew the bad feelings away. We laid there in each others arms, me loving every second of her touch of the aura that she put off. 
     
We never did more than kiss that night and I don't regret it. It wasn't about physical pleasure, it was about the connection that was felt, how one person made the other one feel. That feeling was so powerful and moving, I'd never felt anything like it. To this day, five of the seven nights of a week, I go to bed thinking about that night and recapturing just a bit of that feeling. 
     
But there's an underlying secret in all of this. I love that drug, I love that girl, and in the end I know I can get that feeling by just being with her. The part the drug played that night was not to multiply my feelings for her, but to share in a world that just the two of us were in. It was a new experience for both of us (even though I had done Ecstacy before), I love the experience but even more important, I love knowing sober I can still get my 'fix' by being with her.










Back in 92-93, a new kind of 'ecstasy' tablet swept through the UK rave scene. 'Snowballs' as they were known soon gained notoriety as a very strong and unusually psychedelic pill. They were allegedly manufactured in a small east-european country's government labs in an attempt to generate some foreign currency, and contained upwards of 200mg of MDA. 

I first encountered Snowballs at a large outdoor rave in Scotland. I purchased 3, thinking they were the 100 mg or so MDMA pills which were prevalent at the time. It was my habit to take MDMA in doses large enough to be psychedelic, which would usually entail taking 2 pills initially, followed by a top-up or 2 later on. I was warned as I bought them that these Snowballs should be taken in halves, as they were very strong. So, I took only 1 instead of my usual first 2. Soon I began to feel decidedly unusual. It occurred to me that taking another one might sort me out (it's easy to criticise this kind of reasoning when you haven't eaten 200mg of unexpected MDA). Within minutes, my surroundings, which admittedly were not all that normal to begin with, began to disintegrate into weird Lewis Carroll fragments. Physically, I felt like I was being electrocuted. As for my powers of reasoning....it occurred to me that taking another one might sort me out. It usually did. But these weren't usual pills. These were snowballs. So began by far the strongest trip of my life. Out of body experiences, communicating with strange life-forms (ok they may have been real - you used to meet some interesting characters at scottish raves), and of course plenty of furniture......furniture?

Well, oddly enough, spectral furniture seems to have been an effect peculiar to snowballs - many friends have independently reported similar experiences. You could always spot someone on a snowball in a club - as they crossed the dancefloor, they would invariably squeeze past that chair (chair? on the dancefloor?), step over that little table.....I've seen someone put a glass on an invisible bar with hilarious results. 

So there you have it, I ate 600mg of MDA and survived. By a weird twist of fate, I just happened to have 20mg of Valium handy when I got home, which was just as well cos I think I would probably still be grinding my teeth and staring at the walls otherwise. I really don't recommend taking 3, but a single (or half) snowball was great fun. I miss them a lot actually.








This past weekend I had my first experience dosing on E.  I have to say that it was the best and most memorable night to date for me.  Let me tell you the story....

My two good friends had asked me to join them on the weekend for a rave and if I'd join them in dosing.  I welcomed their invitation with open arms since all I hear is good things about people going on the drug.  We went to our fav bar for a little while about 10:30p.m to 12:30p.m.  We were still looking for the stuff when we left the bar but knew we'd have no prob once we got to the rave.  We searched for a while once we got there and finally found some at about 1:30am.  We took it right away.  My friends had both done it before so I was the only one doing it for the first time.  I was just resting on our blanket for the first 10 minutes or so waiting for it to kick in, every now and then getting up to dance a little.  My one friend kept asking my if I was feeling anything yet and I could but it was just small tracers and a little bit of heat running throughout my entire body.  I started to feel really relaxed.  I sat back down and not even a minute later I had to get back up.  I had this sudden urge to dance, but I still did not feel fucked up yet.  Well not even a minute again later, I stopped dead in my tracks I just looked around at everything.  

The lights, people dancing, the glowsticks in my hands.  It was like a big hand had just pushed me since I kind of stepped back a little and I realized that I was feeling the most intense high of my life.  It was FUCKING AMAZING to say the least.  I felt as if I was literally walking on air and I stumbled back to where my friends were and said 'I'm fucked'.  The night had just started.  It was really intense for the first 20 minutes or so, I couldn't really control my own movements so I decided to sit down a while to get used to it.  It didn't take much sitting to get used to it.  Any kind of shitty feelings I had, had seemed to slip out of my body and it left behind this great sensation.  I couldn't sit still and it stayed that way the entire time.  The next time I remember looking at my watch was at 3:30am and I thought I still had 4 hours or so to go.  I met the best people that night.  I seemed to be on the same wavelength as everybody else.  They all seemed to know what and how I was feeling.  It was great.  You have this ability to talk to anybody and everybody about anything.  You have the greatest conversations with people you've never met before.  I never once the whole time I had dosed had a bad time.  But I think the atmosphere I was in was so friendly and full of positive energy that it would have been hard to have a bad trip.  You have to be prepared before you go though.  Have something to suck on (I did and it helps sooo much), have plenty of water, good friends to be with, a blanket (I seemed to get pretty chilly later on when coming down) and a really good attitude going in.  Give in to whatever your body tells you.  Dance the night away.  

But the night was awesome.  Everybody I met there was mostly doing the same thing I had done, it was called Calvin Klein.  Very good stuff I have to say.  I would dance for a while then talk to some people. I always felt like I had to have something in my hands.  Something to play with. Smoking felt really cool.  I remember that the cigarettes seemed to last forever before they were gone.  Every now and then though I would have to chill out and take a break. Saw some people I hadn't seen in a long time and it felt so good to see them again. I had a really lovey feeling most of the time but it wasn't too intense.  I was really thankful to my friends for inviting me and I kept thanking them.  I find it impossible to get mad at someone while on it but its probably not impossible. I didn't start coming down until about 5:30am and so me and this girl rolled a J and smoked it.  It gave me a little pick me up and I pretty much danced until it was over at 7:15am.  By that time I had come down a lot but could still feel it in my body.  I didn't get to sleep until about 8:30am.  

When I woke up at 5:00pm that same day, I could still feel it.  It was like I wanted to just get up and dance.  I wasn't screwed up like I was the night before but I was still in such a good mood and still really talkative.  I never had any side effects which is good.  Hopefully it will always be this good.  But what I want to tell everybody who considers doing it, read about it first.  It will help you a lot with how you should handle things.  Always be prepared.  I wish you a good trip to all doing it.  Until next time..........








At 7:30pm that day I decided to give my HBW seeds a try. I did suck up a lot of info, as I usually do for months before approaching a new substance.
I decided to eat the seeds on an empty stomach, since I read a lot about the nausea and I really am not looking forward to getting sick on something that is supposed to bring me something pleasant. I decided to keep a sheet of paper and a pen close by, so I can take notes and retell everything, especially the time, which usually gets lost on those experiences.

Back to the report: 7:30pm 6 HBW seeds on an empty stomach, while my baguettes were in the microwave, I was hungry and figured I would be able to eat shortly after I consume the seeds. I'd say about 5 mins after the ingestion my baguettes were ready, but by that time I was not feeling like eating anymore. I was still very hungry but a whole bunch of symptoms began to show....I was NOT expecting the (hammer crushed) seeds to work that fast!! I became VERY hot and felt VERY uncomfortable, VERY dizzy...it was just extreme. And I felt a belly ache, I figured it might be my pants or too tight shorts or something like that....usually not a problem because I have a nice flat belly. I also felt like my wrists are being cut off from circulation, so I pulled my sleeves up, didn't help though.

So I decided to take a bite, after all I was hungry and eating might help me feel better --- NOT. About 10 minutes after those 2 bites I was only able to take those 2 bites decided to come out again, I felt SOOO sick (well I was, doh). Funny thing is though, about 5 mins after vomiting I was sitting in front of my computer and was laughing again, because somehow it was cool. The unpleasant feelings had somewhat disappeared, I felt relieved and better. Only for a little while though.

We are at 8pm now, I have marked four words on my 'trip sheet': dizzy, spinning, tired, disoriented.  I figured the fatigue might come from my workout that afternoon and it was the least thing I was worried about. 

8:10pm: the physical fatigue became extreme, my forarms seemed more cut off than before and my hands almost numb, even so they were functioning alright. I also thought that maybe the lack of energy might have been caused by the lack of food.....I eat a lot all the time and drug experiences are always terrible because I'm hungry but mostly not able to consume anything. But never experienced that fatigue before.  The phone rang twice, I was not able to answer it, felt way too uncomfortable for that.

Now here's quite a turning point in my story....this was not planned to be the normal living room experience, I had tickets for 'Sixth Sense' and was going there at around 8:15pm (movie started at 8:30). I was close to cancelling, but I figured I have the tickets and the nausea might go by. If I would have had to drive I would have remained in my living room, but I didn't want to look for excuses, since I was getting picked up.
Didn't talk much on the way to the movies and was just hoping not to get sick again. My stomach decided otherwise at around 8:28 though and I puked big time again, but with no food intake that wasn't very good. I got a hold of myself though and went in there at 8;30 and actually felt fine now.
What were the effects? I had a change of perception, somewhat like on mushrooms, but without anything moving or changing shape. It just looked like you look through some twisted glass or so, but everything the same. Besides, the movie was excellent on HBW, I had to laugh quite a few times though when nobody else did and I was fascinated by my perception...I saw everything from a third eye perspective, like I was watching a movie on TV where I can see myself sitting in the theater. Awesome.

That was pretty much all that happened, I was lucky to find someone to drive me home right after the movie, since I was starving but not willing to go with the rest of them to some bar. I ate the cold baguettes at home (yuck) and fortunately did not get sick anymore. I sat at home and played some computer game on the internet with a friend and enjoyed the view.
The entire trip was VERY unemotional though, that somewhat disappointed me. I felt completely indifferent all the time. I'll definitely look into it again, but I HAVE to find something against that nausea...if that won't go away I won't touch the seeds again, because if I have to throw up something it can't be alright and that means I won't do it to my body.















I was going into withdrawal from prescription pain killers and decided to use an herbal preparation. Every 6 hrs. I  took a cup of chamomile tea with 2 tea bags, infused them for 20 min.  and drank that down with 2 capsules of valerian root (535 mg. each). I also took 600 mg. of Advil for the muscle aches and pains that come with the withdrawal(every 8 hrs. I took the advil). I still wanted the painkillers but for psychological reasons. The herbal preparations eased the pain of withdrawal. I would eventually like to see a study  done on narcotic pain relievers and their pschological addiction. When I took them they made my depression and my concentration better. I was happy but not too, happy. I wish I could take them forever. Oh well, for now I will concoct my own herbal preparations.












this is about me and my experiences with ketamine, a.k.a. special k. i had done it for the first time a while back. An ex-boyfriend of mine was dealing it trying to make some money and he would give it to me for free. 
in the beginning i would do a bump or two at a time with a key or from a bullet three or four times a day. the first time i had done it i was at this lake near my house in new orleans. i was with two of my guy friends and it was their first time doing it also. it was freezing cold outside and we sat in my friends truck and did two little lines each on my friends truck manual book and with a dollar bill. after we all had our two lines of the ketamine we sat there for a minute and we were saying 'oh yeah I kinda feel it.' i said 'well lets get out of the truck and go for a walk closer to the lake.'

As we got out the truck i realized it felt really different to stand up. we started to walk towards the lake and it felt like we were walking so slow, kind of like slow motion. it was the most beautiful view we had though where we were standing. it was about 5:50 P.M. the sun was setting and the sky was pink and blue swirls with the golden sun at a far distance disappearing. it looked like a painting. i will never forget it i felt so awesome. 

i had a great feeling come over me i felt so comfortable as we stood there watching the sky. i imagine the people who saw us were maybe thinking 'what are they on?' the thing is when people ask me how does ketamine feel there is no way to describe it in my point of view. all i can say is numbness. everything is numb and really visual colors and shapes. its very intense.
well so eventually we were doing more and more of it every day since we would get it for free and it felt so good.  

see, i didnt know anything about this drug. i still don't know that much to this day. i would just snort it and be happy i didnt care what was in it or what the long term effects were. there was only one time i remember that something strange came out of it. i had a out of body experience i believe they call it. 

we were in my garage with the black light on it was freezing cold so me and 
about 8 of my friends were all huddled next to each other and my friend had a whole vile of K that he cooked and cut up. we sat there for a hour or so doing the whole thing. i remember the next thing i knew after i hit my 11th rail of k, everything got quiet i couldnt speak. i then remember looking down at myself as if i was on the ceiling looking at myself. i saw all my friends around me talking to each other and my boyfriend at the time was next to me waving his hand in front of my face. there was no sound even though we had the radio on and blaring some techno. i just saw myself, everyone, everything. i snapped out of it it seemed like a long time but when i snapped out it had only been a minute or so that this happened. 

my boyfriend at the time gave me some coke to drink cause to my knowledge that kills your k-hole high. in a way i was scared. i never even told any of them about this. they thought i was just too messed up to speak, but that wasnt the case. i continued doing ketamine for a while still doing large doses. we started doing about seventy dollars worth a night between three people. even though most people would have probably stopped after that one occurance, i did not. because it is the best feeling in the world. to me it took away all of my problems , pain , worrys when i was on it. 

i just had to learn what my limits were. now i barely ever do it. maybe once every few months. if i could though i would do it everyday of my life. i dont know about the long term affects or anything but i honestly would not care. thats how good it is to me. i dont think it is for everyone though. i think if you like acid and shrooms then you will like ketamine. i remember a few times i mixed cocaine and ketamine that was intense also. i was in a dorm at some college cause my friend was dealing him some k. i would suggest doing that also if you can handle it maybe start out small with a little of each and eventually build up to it. but this drug like all drugs can be dangerous. 

i really like this site i get to read everyone else's experiences and i hope some of you will read mine also. you can probablly tell that i am younger not a adult but nowadays sometimes us teens know more because times are changing and things the adults never knew existed are being discovered by us.

A while ago I bought some 5-MeO-DIPT from an online source. When I first got it, I was surprised at how small it was (250 mg). I don't have a scale that can measure in milligrams so I dumped about 1/3 of the powder in 4 tablespoons of water. At first attempt, I drank 1/2 Tbsp of the bitter solution. The effects were a light tryptamine sensation and slight difficulty being coherent as I was told by friends. 

A few weeks later I downed a tablespoon of the remaining 3 and 1/3 tablespoons, which I kept sealed in a jar in the fridge. That was about 2:30 p.m. I went outside and toated a joint.

At about 3:00, I measured 5 mL (1/2 teaspoon) and downed that. At 3:30, I felt a little wierd and felt like I could read my dog's mind. By 4:15, my jeans were doing the swirling thing that happens on acid. I felt euphoric, vertigo, and every inanimate object seemeed to be alive. I smoked a small bowl of cheap weed which seemed to bring me down. 

I remembered that I had to go to the library to work on a report, so I had my mom drive me just in case. I was disappointed that I had come down so much until we started driving. My seatbelt was trying to squeeze me tight and I felt too big for the car. Which led to paranoia, which led to uncontrollable laughter. Everything in my field of view seemed to have so much charactor and amazing detail. Even the underground parking lot seemed so adventurous, like being in a cave. When I went in, I asked the librarian to use the internet, but couldn't understand her reply. I felt like everybody was staring at me and giving me dirty looks. I didn't get any work done. By 7:30 I was at baseline. This stuff can be fatal when too much is taken, so don't be a dumbass and eyeball it like I did. From what I hear, over 25 milligrams is too much.













My friends and I have been using dxm (robotussin) for about a year and a half. When we started using it we would use it about twice a week.  In  the last six months we have only done it about 6 times. This is the story of my most extreme trip on dxm. We had planned on a 'robo trip' for about three days. We went and bought all the psycadellic equipment such as black lights, posters, etc. 

We set up my apartment and drank 2 bottles of extra strength robotussin at about 8 pm. We waited for about an hour then it hit us.  At about 9:30 pm I started to feel a little sick to my stomache. I went to the bathroom to puke but never did. For the next hour I lay on my couch and tried not to think about puking. I think I may have fallen asleep for awhile but I cant be sure.  The next thing I remember I was in the bathroom looking in the mirror which was a huge mistake. I cant be sure of the time but i think it was about 11 pm.  

As I looked in the mirror many things happened to me.  The two that stick out in my mind were seeing my reflection covered in blood and then covered in shining metal plates. At this point I lost all control of my mind and body. I went and lay on the floor in the living room and closed my eyes. I saw the most intense hallucinations I have ever seen. I opened my eyes which did no good because my whole world had changed. All normal objects were tilted at wierd angles and every so often objects in the room would melt and drip to the floor. I would look at my friends and their faces would be different or sometimes blurry. I had a real hard time identifing them. They would talk to me and I wouldn't know who they were. 

I wandered through my house which now seemed to me to look like a palace of some sort. I went into the kitchen only to find a huge swimming pool where the table was supposed to be. I was so lost I didn't know where I was. I couldn't feel any parts of my body and had trouble moving specific parts. I went back to the couch and lay there for what seemed like hours. I watched my house plant grow till it was about twice its original size. 

The most intense part of my trip happened next. I was sitting on the floor when the wall I was staring at suddenly exploded. I was the only person in a room that seemed to be spinning through outer space. I watched stars and planets fly by me. I would say this lasted for about half an hour. When it stopped I was once again in my room sitting on the floor. I was astounded by what i had just seen. I went to the bed and lay down until I fell asleep. When I woke up I felt energized but very stiff and awkward.  

I have been 'robo tripping' for about a year and a half and never really had a bad trip.  Sometimes I will lose control and think I am never going to snap out of it. Just remember that it's all in your mind and try not to move around too much. I think this adds to the nervousness and confusion. Just sit back in a comfortable spot and enjoy the ride.  All in all I enjoy 'robo tripping', but be careful and try to have at least one person who is sober to trip-sit everyone. It really helps to have someone who is not tripping to talk to about what is going on with you.








After a rather successful mushroom picking expedition into some local pastures, my friend and I decided to try a test sample. Giddy with all of the acquired mushrooms (4 1/4 lbs to be exact), we eagerly placed about a pound of wet liberty caps into a cauldron-style pot of boiling water. We let the tea continue boiling for 30 minutes. At the end of 30 minutes, I took a potato masher and smashed the mushrooms into the bottom of the pot to further extract their juices. The whole mess was then filtered through a large paper towel-lined colander to remove debris. What was left was six coffee cups full of tea so dark one could not see an inch into it. 

We each drank three cups right in a row. Within ten minutes of finishing my last cup, I could feel the psilocybin invading my body. It started in my stomach as almost a tingling sensation and progressively spread out through me. By the time it reached the tips of my fingers, it felt as though my muscles were all being involuntarily flexed. My cheeks became rosy and my eyes lost all color. I thought about every minute thing with incredible intuitiveness. In my euphoric state, people amused me. Simple actions and mannerisms seemed so foolish and unimportant. It was almost as though I felt like some higher being, like a god. I wanted to help people understand how trivial their lives are, I wanted them to see the bigger picture and to be as at peace as I was. I rarely spoke during this time, it seemed like the English language could not allow me to express what I wanted to get across. 

After about six or seven hours, I fell into a sort of numb stuper which can be best described as dreaming while awake. Ever since this experience, I have looked at things differently. The way people act amuses me. Advertisements and marketing strategies seem comical and stupid. Even more comical is the media and the way that people follow its lead like a herd of cattle. I would not recommend this large of a dose for any but the experienced tripper and even to them I give warning. My experience has changed my way of thinking forever.







5-MeO-DIPT was introduced to me as 'the pill that would enhance my reality.'  I'd read interesting things about how it gave new significance to one's surroundings, and I like thinking drugs, so I decided to jump in.  16mg gelcap dropped at 10:30pm or so, and I'd started to feel the come-on stomach flips at about 11:30pm.

12am (T+30min) and going to the bathroom is decidedly pleasant. 

12:30am (T+60min) and taking a shower is decidedly fun.  

1am (T+90min) and (at the advice of my friend) masturbation is decidedly mind-blowing. Colors had a brigher hue and lights cast a same-colored aura around themselves.  While holding a steadily-pulsing light source (which did not heat up at all), I felt its colored pulse as both color and physical warmth in the fingers holding it.  Everything around me seemed to fit together in one great master plan.  Everything did its thing in complement and supplement to everything else.  

When I retreated to my room (1am or so, T+90min), the music I turned on was right on, playing along with my train of thought.  I listened to a few of my favorite albums, and they cast their feeling right through to my core. At around T+3h, I wrote a bunch of email to out-of-touch friends of mine.  I put on _The Very Best of Cream_ and watched my screensaver, Hypercube (a wireframe rendering of a 4D cube collapsing).  The music and the cube danced with each other; the music played further and further into an ever-collapsing feeling and sound. I couldn't get over the beauty and wonder of the collapsing cube, or the complexity of the music, or tales from friends past, or *anything* I thought of.  

The only mindless effects of this drug were the slight color fringe and the odd trait that music sounds tonally lower than it should.  The rest of the 'trip' was thinking, thinking, thinking about everything in your life.  By T+5h I was able to sleep, and I awoke the next morning after a full night of comfortable sleep, feeling fine.

Many propose that 5-MeO-DIPT makes everything seem very fascinating, but always a little incorrect.  I agree.  The most enjoyable part for me and for most people I've talked to was the come-down.  Music sounded lower than it should have.  The cube wasn't supposed to be collapsing infinitely.  Light wasn't supposed to make my fingers tingle with its waves of heat.  Nothing was /quite/ what it was supposed to be.  It is for this reason that folks around here have taken to calling 5-MeO-DIPT 'Incorrect'.

Conclusion: If you want to take a drug and feel happy for six hours, take MDMA.  But if you love to think and you want to feel fine the next day, then I think Incorrect is for you.








I found myself once again sitting alone on a Satuday night, looking for a high. I had no pot or any other more potent drugs, so I searched the internet hoping to find some way to naturally get high. I remembered reading about you could smoke catnip to get high, and I happened to have a good supply of naturally grown catnip layin around. I couldn't find any dosage charts, so I improvised. I made a cheap pipe out of a medecine pill bottle, some aluminum foil, and an ice pick, and filled it with about 1 cubed inch of catnip.

I held the poorly made pipe over a candle for a few minutes until I could smell the fumes from the catnip from a few feet away. I then put the top up to my mouth and inhaled deeply and steadily through the hole in the top of the bottle, then held the vile vapors in my lungs for about 15-20 seconds. It tastes sweet and smells sweet, and it almost 'tastes green'. It is terribly hard to describe with words, but it is like freshly cut grass and someones freshly eaten vomit. I am not trying to just describe something gross, but this metaphor is as close to the awful smell as I can describe. I started inhaling at about 2:30, a few deep breathes for every 20 seconds over the fire or so. By about 3am, I could feel some slight effects even though I was still steadily doing my routine of inhaling every 30 seconds. 
The effects were very mild, and it was a little like a standard, over the counter sedative. My limbs felt heavy, and my vision darkened a little. The effects lasted about an hour, and after the peak around 4am, the high dropped sharply. I became very sick and puked badly. However, I had no problem sleeping even though I didnt feel tired. It was a very deep sleep, but getting up at 1 the next morning was tough. for an hour or so after waking up, I had a terrible full body itch. I cannot be sure that it was from the catnip or not, but my best guess says that it is. Trust me on this - catnip is terrble stuff, and its not at all worth it. Go to the store and buy a few sleeping pills. Mix them with some caffeine pills, and you should get the same effect as this... Its not worth it to smoke this stuff.







I have been using/abusing N2O for about 18 months now. Until a couple of months ago, I was convinced that it was a fun drug and a quick and easy way to get high. Recently, I was way out there on a large dose (about 160 mg) of the best MDMA powder I have ever had. Just before sunrise, a friend and I jumped in the car and headed up to a large park with a tank of nitrous, a bag of balloons, and some amazing goa trance music. We both sat in the car, which was parked at the end of a row of trees, and I focused on a point low to the horizon in the distance. We began to take in breaths from our balloons. I will point out at this stage that I have practiced controlling the rate of intake so that I hover in a semi-concious state, and as such, I still feel like I am in touch with reality but in actual fact, the nitrous is controlling that reality. 

Using this method of controlled intake, I am occasionally able to notice/imagine the point at which the nitrous takes over my conciousness. When this happened, the row of trees became an image of an amazingly  colourful woman, the kind of person you would see in the street and think 'wow, what a wild outfit'. The tree in the foreground became her hair, the balloon in front of me became her stomach, a branch in the foreground made up her facial features. Beyond this image was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen, a tunnel stretching all the way to the point I was focusing on, and at the end of the tunnel was this woman again but now it wasn't a side view, she was animated and 'alive'. I began to have a conversation with her. Details of what we spoke about are hard to describe but I associated what was being 'said' with conversations I had had with people in the past. She was explaining that she was one of them and that she was everywhere, even in the row of trees from which she had been created. She took me back to a time when I was saying to a close friend that someone I had just met through her was really nice and my friend had replied 'of course, he's one of us'. One of us, one of us, one of us, I wondered. 

All of a sudden, I had the answer to every question that has ever been asked about the reason for our existence on this planet. I believed that we were all aliens and that my friends who introduced me to nitrous already knew this and I had to go and tell them that I had joined the ranks of those that knew the truth. My friend in the car got the shock of his life when I came out of it screaming that I was no longer afraid. When he asked me what I saw, I replied, 'If I told you, you wouldn't believe me. When you're ready, they will show you.' 

I called my friend who had said 'he's one of us' the next day and began ranting and raving about all the tests I had passed in that trip and subsequent trips I had had that night until the tank was empty. Slowly and gently she calmed me down, and after a few days of confusion I began to get back in touch with 'reality'. I can't say that what I saw isn't real but I know that if I live my life believing that the answers to the meaning of life are in a tank of gas, then I will be institutionalized.

I still use nitrous and get great satisfaction out of it and I am still able to make contact with that woman and other 'friends' I have made inside the balloon, but each time we meet I just accept the fact that they may be real or they may not, but either way we always have a good time together. The more time I spend looking at the oblects they come out of, be it a speaker, the corner of a room, a tree, a painting, etc....the more I realise that they are parts of my imagination, or is that just the wool being pulled over my eyes yet again?










I thought that I had tried or at least heard of just about every drug known in the West, and so was suprised when I stumbled on a Salvia archive on the web. Always open to new experiences, I decided to try it out.  Happily, the plant is totally legal, and I ordered some online without incident. That was easy! 25 bucks got me a small vial of divine mint that claimed to have an active ingredient content that had been concentrated to 10 times above normal. There was a small label attached that said to exercise extreme caution while using. Curious, I popped off the cap and smelled. Typical herby aroma.

I was alone, confident that I could handle the experience by myself. I closed all the windows, creating a fairly dark atmosphere. Turned on a compilation CD; Tori Amos, Jamaroquoi, lots of different sounds.  Sat on my bed and improvised a little bowl out of tinfoil.  Since I don't normally smoke, it was all I had.  Packed a little, then a little more. Maybe two bowls altogether. Felt the effects come on quickly.

It started with a distortion of vision... I couldn't tell if I was moving up and down or if the room was. I tried to find a comparable experience in my memory right off but failed. It reminded me of a lot of things, but wasn't exactly like anything. I was immediately overwhelmed by the feeling that everything in the room was watching me, or that something was approaching me. It wasn't a bad feeling, quite the opposite. I was anxiously awaiting the unseen presence to make itself known to me, kept expecting a head to pop through the doorway and smile at me. I noticed that I was nude, I hadn't showered all that long ago, and decided that I should put some clothes on before this mysterious presence showed up and caught me in my birthday suit. I don't know why I felt this was necessary, but I rushed out to the living room to get my clothes. 

While I was dressing, I began to notice the things around me.  My sofa, the curtains, everything was radiating this benevolent intelligence. I felt like the furniture loved me. And for the first time I noticed the music.  Korn was on, and I would have thought it would be a little too heavy for the situation, but not at all. There was a new depth to it, the beat was so primal, earthy even.  It felt like the heartbeat of the universe, and it was all around me.  I just sat in the hallway, listening to one song after the other. It didn't seem to matter who it was or what style of music, that undecurrent of beauty was there. It occurred to me how wonderful this drug would be at a concert, or a drum circle. Gradually, I came back to a normal state of conciousness, although as I write this about 45 minutes later, I feel as though my level of awareness has been heightened.

The whole experience was short, but beautiful. I would like to try it again with friends and enough plant to sustain the high for a couple of hours.







At an outdoor party last summer, i was offered some ketamine which i accepted. I was already high on about 300-400 mcg. of lsd and this i am sure had an effect on the outcome of the experience. My friend and i snorted two large lines of uncut ketamine powder...and the following experience was of galactic importance, at least for me. 

After about five to ten minutes i was almost immediately in a world where i was part of a whole...my thoughts were but a small piece of the great  collective thought...every thought i willed was part of a larger domino effect of others' thoughts...hard to explain...things became weirder.  i was a disembodied point of consciousness caught up in a cosmic puzzle...i was at the point where life is created from nothing(?)...warbling its way into existence...we (me and everyone i sensed around me) were all part of some big happening...almost willing the world into existence...after swirling and morphing movements and thoughts, which would be felt and relayed by the greater whole into a final end...it was almost as if i could only do my very small part and just rely on the others to do their's...which i would feel as being jolted around in the large ball of consciousness i was caught up in...a very heavy very real experience.  About half an hour(?) into the trip, the whole project had moved to the point that the whole thing we were trying to accomplish rested on my shoulders...it could succeed or fail depending on my actions in the next few seconds...it was all about getting through a hole which you just couldn't quite make it through...it was amazing how at the moment we succeeded...i was thrust back into the physical world in the middle of the woods just as the sun peeked its head over the morning horizon...amazing...we had done it....and i was...i was I WAS JEREMY...wow, what a concept, i was a person, how totally fucking mindblowing...i had no idea of this...but here i was.  I found my tripping partner who was in a similar state of dazzlement...and this is where the real fun happened...the experience was of the world feeling me, instead of me feeling the world...everything...the air, everything was pure evergy which i could morph and be morphed by using my whole body...as we moved closer together our consciousnesses sort of got caught up in one another's...i was part of her and she was part of me...we couldn't easily break the bond...it was very hard indeed...we were literally part of each other...no matter how we worked together to get free...every effort failed. We would almost have it, just to realise...we were still trapped...oh how i longed to be my own person again...eventually the energy which had been feeling me all over my body made a rush from my toes and fingertips all the way to my head, leaving me to feel the world as one normally does...this also set us free...a very relieving event...i could walk and run and think of my own free will.

This was a pretty heavy trip considering the amount and method of ingestion...but i'm sure the energy of the party, the people, and the forest all related to this being a totally life-confirming experience.









The first time I ever took Ecstacy was a couple of months ago with two friends. Well, one was a close friend, the other I`d never spoken to until that day.

It was about 7:00 PM, and we all decided to take out first pill. We were outside at the time, and it was pretty cold, so for the first hour or so I didn`t feel a thing. I began to think it would all be a waste of money, and that I wouldn`t even come up. Half an hour later, I was still waiting for the pill to take it`s effect, and I was getting pretty miserable outside in the cold and dark. 

Then, about ten minutes later, I began to feel a pleasant tremor going through my body, in short rushes. Almost like an intense tingle going along your spine. These rushes became more frequent and intense, and although it was a pleasant feeling, I thought that I might be overwhelmed by it when I had fully come up. Next, all the street-lights around me seemed to become brigther and sharper, the colours much more vivid. My friend was next to me smoking a cigarette, and I was surprised to see the lit end leave a massive trail wherever he moved it. I can`t explain why, but this image just filled me with happiness, and it was lovely to watch. I could feel a massive grin form on my face and I then knew that I had come up.

By now the group of people I was in was getting larger, almost like a small street party. We swallowed our second pill, and carried on talking. Minutes later, I felt that I could 'see everything' or that my vision was really wide, if you know what I mean. It just seemed to expand my mind. I was looking at one place, but I felt as though I knew what was happening everywhere else. I felt so calm, and at peace. I was shaking hands with people I disliked very much, forgetting any past troubles. I wanted to forgive everyone, and the people `peaking` with me felt the same. It felt wonderful to be around such people, they were so friendly and loving, so trust-worthy, innocent and child-like. 

I then realised, that sub-conciously, everyone who had taken ecstacy (there were about 10 of us now), had all been drawn to each other, and were in a group, distanced from everyone else. We were blissfully unaware of everyone else, and just huddled up to each other to keep warm.

9:30 PM I couldn`t believe that I had been up for only 45 mins or something, because it felt like hours. Our group of 10 people worked our way to a house where we were going to spend the night.  I saw people on the way, people I didn`t know, but I felt affection for them, I felt close to them. I was dying to tell them that I was peaking on ecstacy. I just wanted to share it with everyone. 

When I got through the front door of the house, the warmth felt fantastic! It had the same effect on everyone, we were all talking, and being so friendly with each other. The atmosphere in the that room was electric!

We smoked a couple of rounds of bongs, and I felt wonderful.  Everything 'seemed right'. The pot made me feel like I was tripping, my mind felt as though it was somewhere else, and that my body was sleeping. 

The music was put on, some dance, and to make things even better, my friend had his own strobe-light. 

The effect the music had on my mind was amazing! I could hear things I`d never heard before, and I felt as though I could see or touch the music. The room I was in began to feel like the centre of the universe as I was listening to the music, and everything outside seemed so insignificant.

I felt like I could communicate to everyone else in the room without speaking, as though we could read each other`s mind. I found it very strange when someone said or did something I was thinking about just a moment before....and this happened several times.

The strangest thing that seemed to happen, was when we were all sitting down listening to the music, when all of a sudden, at exactly the same time, six of us jumped up to dance. We were all just looking at each other and smiling as though we had all experienced the same feeling and urge to dance, at exactly the same time. This really felt as though we were just part of one joint conciousness, instead of individuals.

By second pill must have taken it effect without me knowing. I say this because I was dancing for what seemed like an hour, stopping to get a drink every so often.  I was beginning to feel it wear off slightly, so I looked at the clock, and was amazed to see it was 3:00 AM! I couldn`t believe how time had passed.

From then on I began to feel a little tired and run-down, and fell asleep on the kitchen floor for the rest of the night, strange as it may seem.

Overall, this was a very positive experience for me, I feel like I have seen the world in a totally new perspective, or seen things that only a few people have seen.

Generally now, I am more friendly and considerate towards other people. I feel like I can empathise with them and really relate to them.

Anyway, I would recommend ectascy, especially in a small group, because the emotional bonds and attachments formed are pretty amazing I think, and it will change the way you view life forever.









This weekend, I did XTC for my second time.  Last weekend being my first. My first time doing it, it didn't kick in for about two hours.  I am on medication, called Dexedrine, so after like an hour I wasn't rollin' I was getting pretty worried that it wouldn't work because of my medicine, but it finally kicked in.

I rolled for a good five and half-hours, it was a blast. I wanted to hug everyone; there was mad love for everyone.  I came to realize that was the best trip I have ever had.  So I was so excited to try it again, I went out and bought some cool lotion because I sure did use a lot of it last weekend, and I got all prepared to have, well lets just say fun.  So finally Saturday was here and I was so stoked.

My Boyfriend and I both dropped (blue surf) about 6:15 p.m.  One of my friends has been chewing candy for a long time, so I went to him with all of my questions.  I started to feel a little sick about 20 minutes after I took the pill, so I asked him what was going on and he said I was peeking and I should get up and move around, so I did.  After that I felt great, like I could go out and run a marathon, a little different than the last time I rolled.  My friend also helped me out a little with glow sticks and put on some tight music, so I was feeling real good after that, until the cops showed up to where we were.

We had to leave there and go somewhere else. We couldn't find anywhere to go so we ended up at a friends house.  It was so boring I stopped rolling after about three hours.  I was so mad.  Everyone else was still rolling but me.  My immune system must suck.  I took Blue Smurfs this time and last time Green Nikes.  I definitely recommend XTC to everyone.  It's the best feeling.  I just wish I would have rolled longer. :)~









This was, honestly, the best night of my life, it took place July 12th, 1999.

A good friend of mine, and I had been waiting for this day for what seemed like ages.  We were off to a Phish show, in Mansfield, Massachusetts.  We both had planned to trip there.  I had done acid once before, however was eager to try it again, we got our gear ready, and headed for the concert, smoking an occasional bowl, in my glass bubbler, on the ride up, anxiously awaiting the show.  When we got their I was amazed at how easily it was to retrieve drugs, just about anything imaginable.  (One thing I would like to mention at this point, is that buying drugs from people you do not know isn't bright, you could be taking anything, and i don't recomend it!) 

We were a little cautious at first fearing narc's and whatnot.  But, eventually someone approaced our car and offered us liquid, I accepted the offer.  We paid him, then he asked me to place out my hand palm down, I did, and I counted 7 drops of the acid dropped on my hand... I instantly licked it off.  My friend did the same.

We had about an hour, till the doors opened, for the show.  I remembered from my last trip, that it kicked in, about 45 minutes after ingestion.  It had been about that time, and we both hadn't felt a thing, I began to fear that we had been ripped off.  Now completly convinced that we had been fooled, we purchased a quarter of mushrooms, and began to munch on those.  My friend had eatin about 2 caps and decided that they were gross, and didnt want to eat anymore.  So I was left to finish the bag.  Now it had been 5:30, and the doors were now open, we smoked a few more bowls and headed to the gates.

Almost instanly, as we got up out of our smoke filled car, I began to feel a strange feeling, as if someone was tickling me lightly, all on my legs, arms, and face.  This body high was unbelievable, I knew that no mushrooms would take effect within 10 minutes, so I feared that we were never 'ripped off,' and concluded that this was going to be a fun night.  By the time we got in the show and found a seat, the acid was working tremendously, and i could start to feel the begining effects of the mushrooms.  My mind was racing, I was thinking about so many different things.  I pondered about my life and what kind of person I was. I felt as if everything, and everyone in the world was beautiful, I felt no hate to anything.  I was at one with myself for the first time, it was going to be a good show!  The visuals, were just as strong as the body high, I watched my friends face melt before me, and also saw alot of tracers, and color distortion.

Our seats were on the lawn, people as far as the eye could see, it was an amazing site.  I found myself talking to persons I had never met before, which is not like myself.  As soon as the show started I felt as if I was begining to peak, the music was loud, and I loved it.  I could feel every string on the guitar, every beat on the drum, every note on the piano, and all the bass flow through my body.  The feeling was exotic, my mind was still racing, it was almost overwhelming, I felt as if I was on some sort of mission searching for something, but I didnt know what.  My friend, and I hardly talked till intermission.  I knew he was feeling the same as me.  During one part of the show, all the people in the lawn, took their glow sticks, and necklaces, and begun to throw them in the air.  This sight was amazing, I looked over the crowd of people and saw bright, neon, flashing colors bouncing off every person in the crowd, this continued for what felt like a good 5 minutes straight.  I stared in awe for that entire time.  This was the best night of my life, happy people, and mind-blowing music.

By the time intermission hit, I was completly fucked up, almost too much, however we did take an excessive dose.  I almost couldn't control myself, i couldn't have a conversation because I was just thinking so much.  I looked at my friend, he smiled, and I did the same, we both knew we were having a great time and no words needed to be shared.  At one point during intermission, someone came up to us, noticed that I was wearing 3-d glasses, (the kind you see at fireworks) after talking to me he knew I was tripping my balls off, and he took advanatge of this.  He introduced himself to me, saying 'hi my name is jim,' and he reaced and shook my hand.  He continued to do this, he kept saying 'hi my name is jim' as if to keep my mind on that thought.  Eventually I looked down, and noticed he had his hands in my pockets, he had what was left of our herb, and my bubbler.  I took back my stuff and pushed him down, I was extremely frightened by this, knowing that I had no idea that 'jim' was tooling through my pockets, I almost lost all my stuff.  I was convinced that this person had figured I was tripping, and probly had done this to people throughout the night, luckily I caught him before it was too late.  After this strange happening, I stayed on top of myself for the remainder of the night, I took control of what was going on, and was alot more aware of my surroundings.  

Next Phish started the second set, I was still feeling great and knew the night was still young.  I had alot more visuals in the second half of the show.  I remember looking at the blue, and purple lights, shine on the crowd in front of us.  It looked like a blue/purple ocean of people, flowing all around me.  The light show was incredible, and added a whole new perspective to my visuals, I was in my own fantasy world, and I wanted to stay in that moment forever, I wished everyone could experience this with me.  During the trip, I realized alot about myself, and my life, I wanted to be better person, and I feel I am since that day.  All the thinking from that night, relieved my mind of a great weight, which had been holding me back for awile.  But like all good things, the show came to an end.

I had such a positve trip, besides that 'jim' instance, but the whole night was a experience I wont forget.  It was like a story that all made sense in the end.  I suppose anyone who has tripped knows exactly what I am talking about.  Now that we were'nt tripping as hard as before, we sat in the car, smoked, and talked about our experience.  The next morning my mind, and body was tired, but I felt fine, just rested for the day.  I find it hard to tell people about the Phish show, it was too amazing to explain with words.  Till this day, I look at the concert stub, and remember that night, I can actually say that I'm glad that I tripped.  I truelly beleive it changed who I am, in a positive way.








What I took I am still not sure about to this day, but it has no resemblance to any psilocybin trip that I have heard of and is a lot closer to the LSD trips that I have heard of.  Of course many people say that the trips are very similar.  I had done shrooms once before with a friend and had eaten an eighth of them then as well.  I smoke marijuana a little more than occasionally and was intrigued with tripping.

Christmas break was arriving and I was to go home for it from college.  I was bringing a whole half of an ounce for me and my friends.  The night that we decided to do it turned out very awry.  My ex girlfriend and her friend came over and my best friend and me and them ate these shrooms at nine o'clock PM.  We ate them with Teddy Grahams, which makes them quite tasty.  They were dried and covered in blue something.  Stripes of blue all up the sides and everything.  In our haste we walked right by my parents and I realized that I forgot to say goodbye, something odd.  I said that I should go back and I went in to talk to my mom.  She tried to engage me in conversation and I noticed that I was having massive problems with communication.  I was already tripping!  That is one thought as to why LSD might have been on it.  We drove up into an area called the Canon behind my house and we decided to walk around.  It was cold, though and we soon came back to the car to sit and wait for the onset of the shrooms.  I was already feeling very, very odd.  I was laughing almost uncontrollably at everything and I realized that I was really tripping when I couldn't stand being in the car anymore.  I was squirming all about and even started crawling all over the seats.  So, we got out of the car to walk.  

Nobody was quite feeling it yet except for me.  A bad part was probably that I was doing it with my lovely ex only three weeks or so after we had broken up and maybe two after she had screwed another guy and only after she had come back to me.  Emotional problems were very hard that night.  I noticed that I couldn't explain very much very easily as we were walking.  My ex was laughing hysterically and I realized that I wanted her to shut up so I turned around and screamed at her, not feeling what I was actually saying.  I wanted to hug her and tell her that I was sorry, but I was completely afraid of anyone touching me.  Especially my best friend.  He had the appearance of a circus clown in a certain light and I wanted him more than anyone not to touch me.  Well, he was the only one that would come near touching me.  I was pacing in circles and raving in my head, thoughts going so fast that I don't remember what they were.  I remember my ex dancing in the street like a little hippie and her friend being completely stagnant, so I stopped paying attention to them.  I stepped off of the road for a car and in the snow (the melted holes to the ground) was a face of a skull staring at me, gaping with its jaws in a sinister laugh.  I remember then that everyone was in the snow piling it into their faces and my friend Ian was raving about how we needed to be with our friends and go to the woods.  I was afraid of the skulls and bones in the snow so I stayed on the road, which enraged him.  I started to see a low humm on the horizon of mixed colors, blue, green, red, yellow, it was beautiful.  

I then looked to the sky and I saw the stars melting downwards.  They were very pretty and I asked one for its permission to hold it.  I then reached up ito the sky and pulled it down to talk to it.  I played with it for a moment and then let it snap back into position as though rubber attached it to the sky.  Then the stars took me over, I battled them.  They captured me and all that I can say was that I was locked into their gaze with this orgasmic like feeling all through my body.  I know that I was moaning very loudly as it felt amazing.  When I finally accepted the stars into me I saw the face that was in the stars.  Later I associated this face with god, but not until later.  At this point I was just communicating with it through my mind.  My ex's friend had grown cold (she had eaten maybe a half of an eighth) and she had my ex walk back to the car with her.  I knew that I was losing my mind and that I was on the verge of not being able to make rational decisions, so I voted to follow them as Julia, my ex's friend, had thoughts of real things like cold which I could only understand that I could not understand.  She seemed still sane to me. My friend, Ian, was in the bushes raving about how we were all fucking idiots and we could not leave it behind.  I somehow convinced him to come with me, I think because he cared about me and knew that I was too scared to stay without the sane one, Julia.  I went to them and just sat under a streetlight with my ex thinking and telling Julia that she was sane and I didn't want her to leave or we would be lost.  She decided to walk home, about three blocks, and then we were lost.  

Ian returned to the riverside woods and my ex and I sat raving in a streetlamp aura like maniacs.  We had taken some vitamin C because of what we had heard about how it makes it better.  I subsequently had the bottle in my sweatshirt pocket.  I started thinking then for the first time about how she had screwed that other guy because she started saying that she could not differentiate between there and where she goes to school.  Well, she was trying to say that but it kept coming out that she couldn't tell the difference between me and her fling-buddy.  I didn't care at this point, I thought that it didn't matter because it happened, oh well.  Then I turned and in my hood I saw LONG blonde hair next to my face, like her fling-buddy had.  I thought suddenly that I was him and he was me.  The reason that she had confused the two places was due to the fact that he did things like go insane on drugs and her image of me was always a little more conservative, although I am quite the opposite.  Well, I suddenly became filled with the idea that this guy and I were one complete person and we were individuals of a single human side.  He was happy, goofy, joking, flirting.  I was romantic, serious, thinking, loving.  We became one at that moment.  

Then I turned away from her and looked to the tree.  Again, like with the stars, I became rapt with some odd power that overtook my entire body.  It screamed into me and I stared at this tree as it froze with a solid sheet of ice over it and then turned into a face of an old man, quite like the stereotypical god image with the beard and heavy brow.  We communicated for a while through our minds and expressions and then he turned into man, many faces.  They were all staring at me when one of them looked at me as though I had stepped on its toes.  I turned and ran away.  Not remembering this I had in that time thrown the car keys at my friends because they were cold and needed to get warm. That was about the only rational thought that anyone had all night.  They were now sitting in the car and I approached it with an intriguing curiosity.  I passed the car and looked again to the sky.  It spoke to me.  When I finally did approach the car I opted for the passenger side as my best friend was in the drivers seat and his goofy faces and hysterically fast moving manner was pissing me off.  

I had already begun talking the vitamin C bottle and communicating with it.  It kept telling me to eat them so I was sucking them down one after another.  I finished off half of a very big bottle quite easily.  Approaching Tiff's side I realized that I needed help, why I don't know.  They had to open the door for me, though, because I could not figure it out, what it was.  They opened it and I still didn't know if I wanted to get in or not.  What followed was a ravingly lunatic conversation consisting mostly of the word 'fuck.'  I was yelling at my best friend because he would yell at me to get in the fucking car and I would almost decide to when I would yell at him to shut up and he would.  Then he would turn and yell again and betray me so I always ended up walking away and talking to the stars again.  

Then, one time, I went over to his side.  I looked at his face and he turned and smiled at me and he was satan.  He had been banging his head on the window and had two lumps where horns would be, so they were there as were the fangs dripping blood and the fire in his eyes and also the music.  At one point before I had looked at him sitting among some rocks that appeared to me as piles of dead and bald bodies committing very sinful acts of the flesh.  In his shirt stripes when he became satan were those bodies again, fucking like mad.  Well, I was not scared of this, but actually quite aroused and intrigued and also it set me into a stir of comedy.  I felt associated in no way to either one of these people at this point.  My ex had become a mannequin with a flapping jaw at one point and was now a dripping mushroom candle that I had an amazing urge to 'hop' on top of.  She was dripping all over herself like a candle.  My friend had taken a bag of her belongings and thrown them all over the place.  He was also throwing weeks old tortillas at me with vengeance and I was a raving lunatic.  I could have easily been committed as all of us could have.  

I looked up to the trees to escape the lunacy of the other two (I felt sane while they weren't, even though I was actually worse) and I saw a very sexy, feminine tree and my mind took note of it as it stretched high above me, higher and higher.  Then I looked to her right and there was a small and dumpy pine tree that was very angry at my attempts to hit on his wife.  I didn't want a barroom brawl, so I walked away and told him that he had had one too many.  Then as I returned to the car a cop pulled up along side the passenger side where I was standing.  He immediately rushed us and accused us of being drunk.  There was stuff thrown all over around the car and Tiff had been nibbling on the tortillas and making a paste out of it and putting it on the seat.  When he accused us I retorted loudly that we hadn't been drinking, as we hadn't.  He asked us then why he smelled it so strongly.  As he looked in the rear windows with his flashlight I made a small attempt to bite his neck but the noise of it caught his attention too quickly and his gaze returned, calming me down.  He told us that park hours were over and that we should leave.  

A sense of rationality did overcome me at that point and I opened the door, got in and we drove off.  Driving up to Tiff's house I looked at my skin and saw the ivy crawling all over it. The trees outside were changing colors and the road was swimming away from us.  We made it safely, I don't know how, and went up to Tiff's very happy room.  I looked into the mirror and saw my face melting everywhere.  Lucky that I was in Tiff's home as it was my second home for the previous year and a half.  I could move my face like it was clay and all of her feminine condiments were swimming atop the counter.  They were ebbing like the ocean.  I went into her room and sat on the floor.  Ian was on the bed hoping for nothing more but to be sane again.  For some reason it didn't hit me that anything out of the ordinary was happening.  I was playing with Tiff's miniature poodle and it was jumping to and fro leaving itself all over my hands.  The floor was ebbing like water and I had the most tremendous sense of comfort and warmth.  

I was looking into Tiff's eyes and realizing what children we had been for so long, fighting with each other and such.  I knew then that I loved her perfectly and beautifully.  She was looking at me with the same warmth.  Ian, not feeling very at home, was almost crying.  I had him sit next to me on the floor and I just held him.  I held him and soon Tiff crawled up under an arm.  I felt so much love and I never wanted it to end.  I felt as though I would have been happy sitting in that room forever just holding them.  They felt like the warmest family that I had ever had.  I didn't ever want to leave and I almost started crying because I knew it would.  I was holding Ian when I realized that I could easily kiss him romantically, that I was sexually attracted to him.  That was the start of my acknowledgment of my bisexuality.  It was so amazing.  I felt at home and complete for the first time in my life.  I was watching the walls melt all around me and it was so amazing.  At that point it was around three in the morning.  

We drove around and looked for Julia after that because we did realize that she could have gone anywhere if she had lost her mind relatively as badly as we had.  We couldn't find her and assumed that she had found her home because we had, even though she had no one else there.  We were still tripping hard and went back to Tiff's to cool down.  We watched the walls melt until around six in the morning when Ian decided that he needed to go home.  I watched the trees all around me growing and moving and knew that I was too afraid to be alone.  Tiff stayed at my house and the only thing that could comfort my eyes to sleep, around nine a.m., was thinking about vanilla frozen yogurt.   I slept for a while and woke up still tripping hours later.  I had flashbacks very strongly for a long, long time.  In fact, I still do at night when we are on roads in a car or when I am typing at my computer, especially with music.  Whatever I took was beautiful, I am shrooming again this weekend.  I was blown away.  I highly suggest going insane for a night, it brought me into perspective.  I felt for a long time as if my life was simply building to that point and then I finally hit it, I finally was real.  Now I am whole.  It completed something in me that is unexplainable.  It made me realize that I had never matured past seven years old and at that point I went through every stage of maturing that there is.  










At around 9 in my room, in almost darkness, straight after having the K I smoked (quickly) the Salvia in my bong. I lay back and what happened was incredible.

I was rolled up into a line, which was then rolled up into a point (which was everything in the universe at once). From there I was shown (by 'god') how the entire universe was unfolded and how each person is an extension of a far greater 'hyper' being. This all happened in about 3 minutes. As it finished I found myself in my room again, rather stunned, but feeling fine (with normal K effects again). It left me feeling very happy about myself, as I am now not afraid of death, having had the very strong feeling of being part of better, greater being.

I will do it again, probably tonight, as I felt that more would have allowed me to move around and interact more with the higher dimension I was in. Before I was only in it observing the normal world and being able to affect that, but not the 'space' I was in. I also feel that 'god' was trying to explain something more to me and I wanna know what it is.

PS: I am not an experienced tripper, having only been taking drugs for a couple of years.






4 gr. Of P. Harmala seeds were extracted according to the Ott Method, then the resulting liquid was drank.

About 20 minutes after, I ate the mushrooms (4 gr.).

Mind set was not very great, I felt a kind of tension within me, but dont know from where it comes (I had a not very good week actually, lot of events bringing in tension, maybe it was that).

As the mushrooms started to push, I knew that this journey would not be like the others. I remember thinking ' Here you gonna go through something very hard on this evening, Youll do it, Youll get through, but its gonna be quiet HARD '. As the rushes were getting more intense, the tension would not leave. I was totally unable to enjoy those rushes I love so much in ordinary times. I spent the first two hours trying to find what was the source of this tension, I checked out many aspects of my life I should improve, but although it allowed me again to see clearly (and deal with) some of these situations, I was totally unable to find what was the problem on this very evening. I was totally unable to enjoy anything, music, reading, light, darkness, nothing absolutely nothing was saitsfying. Everytime I was thinking about doing something, the only reply I could have was nothing, NOTHING, NOTHING ! ! ! ! !

I was nothing, I felt nothing, I was in the nothing, part of the nothing, I was experiencing the NOTHINGNESS aspect of the life, and its very very VERY boring, sure. Around 1 hour after the first effects of mushrooms were felt, I snorted two lines of Yopo. Although on a previous journey, it acted marvellously on peaking psylohuasca (great colors, great power, great love), this time it was not sure the same, still unable to enjoy (dont dislike, no, but unable to enjoy, like the pleasure channels in my brain would have been cut). I felt the physical, lovely warmed rushes, my hears were whistling, but nothing else. 

The third hour was almost the same. But it changed as I was reading an article about Penan (native people from Indonesia living in the jungle), in this article was a little photo representing the Sarawak forest. What shocked me (really) was that on the right part of the photo was the forest, dense, green, until the landline, but on left part of the photo, nothing, NOTHING ! ! ! Wheres the forest ?, no more, only dirt and sand a real waste land. Seeing this put me in a real hanger, I was totally disgusted, crying, thinking « How can they do that ? ! How can they bring so much destruction just to satisfy people who love exotic woods ? They kill, annihilate thousands of life, they destroy the house of the Penan like in many other parts of the world, they destroy the forest and the people living within it, and their knowledge goes in smoke with them. What would we do if somebody come and destroy the whole city/village/place (or whatever) we live in, just to take out the toilet washbowl, because somebody outerseas like the colour, the shape our the texture of our toilets ? This is a crime against Humanity ! ! ! 

My thoughts were going more and more virulent, and at the end I was calling the Armageddeon on humanity, my mind was crowded with really apocalyptic thoughts, but at that moment, an insight came to me « No They all deserve to live, whatever they do (good or evil), because its LIFE, because theyre part of the LIFE, because LIFE is within them, because theyre LIFE, because of the incredible energy of LIFE flowing in all of them, this energy wich give us the strenght to go beyond our limits, our fears, this energy which makes us love, etc. All of them deserve to live.

Ive been crying during all this hard time, and after that I was feeling really better, I felt like the tension has been gone. 'Nice', I thought, 'Im able again to enjoy things', so I decided to snort some Yopo again. Here was the mistake, I snorted really too much of it. I felt rapidly that it was too much, an intracranial pressure was felt, all my body was under pressure. But along that I was blew out. I was laid back on my bed in the darkness, listening to Colombian music, my eyes were half closed (or half opened), and I saw lots of mosaics (totally different from those of mushrooms or LSD, here it was more precise, more detailed with a different shape (looked a lot like giants drawing of the NAZCA culture.

I remember seeing a digitalized heart floating in the air (dont know whether it was mine or not), and then I « heard » my own heart « saying » « you took too much Yopo, I dont like it, its too much ». Pressure was still here, and I just wanted it to calm down. But!
 NO ! ! !

The only light which was on, was a candle, at some moment I looked at my hands and « wow, whats happening, looks like theyre swollen ». So I went to the bathroom to check it and to check wether my face was purple or not (dont know why it would have been as only intravenous bufotenine make your face turning purple). My hands were really looking very swollen, but I was not 100% sure of it as I was deeply hallucinating. As I was staring at them, I felt something not cool at all coming, you know this kind of rush you get when youre at the point to collapse. I quickly seated myself on the shower socket and... WHATS HAPPENING ? What the fuck is this ? CONVULSIONS ! ! ! ! Fuck that !

My body was totally out of control, shaking convulsing. AWFUL ! ! !
I managed to get my body  under control and go back to lay onmy bed, but these fucking, terrifying convulsions came again. Am I going to die ? No ! fuck it I dont wanna die !  I started fighting the convulsion (fighting against my own body !), fighting to get through, fighting for survival, and finally it stopped. I could only see big flashes, explosions of fireworks for about 20 seconds after it. I was sweating profusely, totally blasted away, shocked by the tremendous experience I had just get through.

But it was not totally over, My heart ? ! ; whats going on with my heart ? , Its pulsation rate was considerably slowed, no more than 50 BPM I didnt know what to do. All I wanted was it to stop, I wanted to sleep nothing else now. But no, I didn t slept right after. The light was on now. And the visual aspects was dramatically different than before, everything looked like I had a blue-purple filter in front of my eyes. It was very strange. When I passed a hand in front of me, it left behind it very strange trails (the correct word would be AGRESSIVE !) very persistent, still with this purple tinge (very dark, like egg-plant), and at the place of my fingertips were very dark, enormous, purple spot.

Sometimes when I turned my head my vision visual field was not following at the same speed. If I looked something on my left, then turned my head to the my right, the left-vision I had maintaind itself on my visual field, with some parts of it blowing into very little mosaics pieces, then my vision accorded to my visual field, it was very strange. In the darkness, my visual field was filled with colourfull, VERY COMPLICATED elaborate mosaics, with still those so tiny pieces. Sometimes it was not coherent going everywhere from anywhere, other times, it represented NAZCA-like drawings or kind of big monstruously deformated gods faces (Latin American style, but with some thing different, something VERY OLD, even PRIMITIVE !, not in its shape, but within the energy coming out from them. Music was still running, but sooo speedly, the rythm was considerably accelerated, as the voices were, how strange !

But I was so tired by the experience, and so scared too. I wondered several times whether I would be alive or not the morning after. I was too shocked to be able to enjoy, All I wanted was it to stop, me to sleep and wake up alive. I felt mike my heart was feeling better (I dont know if it felt really bad anyway, although I know it didnt LIKE the Yopo overdose, as it told me, the rate pulse has slightly increased, but still no more than 60.)  I was feeling a little  better  now, and I felt that all would be OK. So I decided to go sleeping and managed to did so.

The day after, I woke up in an inabitual state of mind, Sure I was physically tired, but I felt strange like I would have been disconnected from some levels of the reality surrounding us, Its not easy to describe. I was considering things and events coldly, with no feelings (good or bad, lovely or awfull) no point of view, i was seeing them just as they are, not how, why, with which goals, etc. Only they are parts of something very big running and which has to run without feeling, or if it has some, its of another kind unreachable to human being. 

Theres at least one thing beneficial I take out from this hard experience. Better awareness of my body parts and better control on it. Maybe it is due to the fact that I managed to take back the control of my body to me (it didnt want to) as I was undergoing convulsion, my mind had TO FIGHT against my body and it won. Anyway, since that , my sense of rythm had been truly improved (I had good one before this anyway), never danced or played jembe like this before, I have really better reflexes too, I feel my body like Ive never felt it before.GREAT ! ! ! My dreams seems to have been a lot improved since. Theyre much clearer, I remember them well better than I used to, theyre often about traveling (I like it a lot !)

Be careful guys if you try Anadanenthera snuff, never take more than a whole seed, a half one is even better. And for your first time, dont mix it with someting else. It can be very rewarding if well used, but it can be shattering if not well used. 

I prepare it by toasting the seeds in my oven. When the colour of the inside is the same that one of the bark, its OK (it should be reddish brown, or brownish red if you prefer). If the inside is yellow green or orange green, its not ready, if its black its good for the trash. This was one of my big mistake for this evening. The first seed I prepared was yellow green and the other was black and I didnt try to prepare correctly a third one. So i took a mix of the bad prepared ones....
Two other mistake occured this time : bad mind set, and I ate a lot during this afternoon preceding the journey (too much tyramine from the foods ?).
These mistakes I wont make them again, you can believe me.

Enjoy brethrens ! But ever be careful, its serious business.







Psilocybe Tampanensis (Philosophers' Stones) (4 gr. + 1 gr.), Psi. Cyanescens (1 gr.), Peganum Harmala (2.5 gr.), Hash and Weed (a lot)

First I want to apologize, as I'm French and my English is not really perfect, I think you'll all understand what I've written anyway.

I prepared a decoction of 2.5g of Peganum Harmala seeds by extracting them twice according to OTT method. The resulting beverage was drunk at 20:30, after that I smoked a little joint of Nepalese Temple Ball.

Very light dizzyness was felt about 5 minutes later but not disturbing, feeling quiet cool. A gentle warmth was now spreading through my body.

At 20:52, the effects were now stronger, so I ate 4 gr. of Psilocybe Tampanensis (dried, cut in little slices), they taste like nuts, a little acidic. I took the Mushrooms' fragments left after I cut them, and smoke them in a pipe with some Kashmir Hashish. Immediatly after the pipe I lighted a Malana Cream joint. The pipe had its little effect, light colored trails were appearing following my hand . Colors are starting to change, some kind of electric (I was reading a magazine about nature at this moment, with nice, colorfull photos). It's now 21:00.

21:06 : It's beginning to push stronger now.

21:08 : It's coming realy stronger, I lay down on my bed.. 

21:20 : Very strong rushes have been coming since 5 minutes, feel very good. Light nausea and a few abdominal cramps when I move (It won't last). 

21:30 : rushes are stronger and stronger, and suddenly something like a click happened. Rushes are still here and strong, but they're not the same anymore, I feel a kind of clarity in my mind.

In front of me (I'm still laid back on my bed) there's a big picture of Bob Marley, his face is continualy changing in shape, size and colors, mosaics are runing all over the yellow walls. I'm listening Ummagumma by Pink Floyd (crazy music) and it's sure « stimulating » the trip.

22:00 : I light up a joint of very high quality indoor grown sativa, and it's sure helped. A higher level of rushes is now reached. Wow It's really strong, everything is flowing, breathing, changing colors and shapes, and I still feel very calm, mind clarity is astonishing, I'm laughing of the insights coming to me, they're totally different kind from those I had with LSD, It?s so clear here, not a hint of mental confusion. Everything seems so clear to me, I've never experienced such a clearmindedness with psychedelic, usually it was mental confusion for almost all the journey, very difficult to talk or to understand. Here it was not the case. That's it : Perfect clarity of mind, EXTRA CLEARMINDEDNESS !. The curtain has been put down and now I see ! I know ! I understand ! These mushrooms deserve their name, you can believe me, it's incredible. I was thinking about my heroin addiction, and the way it revealed itself to me made me understand finally that this is not life. Everything which seemed normal to me, what heroin had made looking normal, the mushroom blasted it away and I realised that NO, those things were not normal, I've been fooled by the dope for all this time. My mind was made up, I would never take heroin again. Now I'm gonna live and enjoy REAL LIFE !

22:30 : I lighted up a second sativa joint. The mushrooms effects came stronger again, colors are so beautifull ! closed eyes imagery is very complex, geometrical. I decided to eat the left gram of P Tampanensis.
At that time, two of my best friends arrived, they had arrange a rendez-vous with their dope dealer at my place (as usual). As they arrived I saw them in a very strange way, I saw them, without blindedness given by the heroin, as they really are, and WOW it was really disgusting. I saw them as dirty, lost, negative, (almost) mentally, (totally) spiritualy dead people. I was not thinking good things about them and I begun to feel very repulsive about them. But I told my self « Hey those are your friends whether they're dope addicts or not, you can?t think such things about them !. 

Instead of it, I was feeling very euphoric, often laughing because of the derision of the things I saw or said.

Finally I asked them to leave because they were sending to much negative energy and I was afraid they would have spoil my journey. Anyway, They?re still good friends, even if they're still in the dope. But seeing them this way gave me more motivation to stop the dope. They proposed me some brown sugar, but I refused it in a totally natural way, « Non Merci ».

After they left around midnight, I shut down the light and laid back on my bed listening, with my walkman, some tribal music from Colombia.
Here it really started, the music brought out the effects of the mushrooms intensively, multicolors patterns where flowing everywhere, mosaïcs, spirals, Imagery was very intense and it would not change whether my eyes were closed or open, exactly the same and then it began, I felt an incredible power surrounding me, I was no more in my bedroom, I don't know were I was, but it was not my bedroom. I penetrated another dimension filled with love and peace. I started breathing « in rythm » with the music and after a few minutes I felt like one of my chakra in the adomen was WIDE OPEN. Regularly, around every 30 seconds, my abdomen was plunging at the level of this chakra, and at those times I was feeling incredible levels of energies penetrating me, this was pure positive energy, pure love. with the music blasting in my ears, I was feeling like at the end of each song I had passed another level of consciousness and knowledge, it was leading me further and further, I was feeling like I was in a passage or initiation ritual.

At the tapes ended I lighted on the light, I was wiped out but still very clear in my mind, no confusion at all.

I decided to take the Psylocibes cyanescens and did so.

Know that the light was on and the music off the visual aspect was more intense than before but I realized that I was no more alone, something was here, « It » was here. Love peace and compassion were surrounding me, they were almost palpable, it was incredible, I was in total bliss.. But this was so much love, so strong bliss that I exploded in tears of love and compassion. I cried and cried again but it was so gooooooood. Waves of love were submerging, spirits of peace and knowlege were floating around me wispering and stroking me. My face was covered by tears and from my nose was flowing huge quantities of sea-water tasting (not like tears, really like sea-water) nasal mucus, it was flowing so much that I took a trash and kept my nose over it, mucus flowing and flowing again, I was unvoluntary breathing in a very strange, way very very deeply and noisy (I've never breathed like this, or maybe at the moment of my birth, but I don't « remember »), and noisy (1) . It was the power of the music (I've been listening to colombian music on my stereo for the rest of the journey) along that of the mushroom, I was undulating and breathing in rythm with « something » in the music, another kind of rythm but inaudible. I told my self that I was undergoing an healing session.  And then I remembered that P. Tampanensis were attibuted some healing properties (but it was not specified wich one), and during the first 3 hours I get to pee a lot of times (and still after), like I was purging my self, and then now, my nose was flowing again and again as it was purging and then it Hit me BAM !, that's it !

It's for dope ! ? It cures from dope ! ? IT CURES FROM DOPE ADDICTION ! ! ! ! ! !

and BAAAAAAAAAAAAAM It hit me again, but really much much stronger, more love, more peace and compassion, more bliss it was stronger and stronger. And I was crying stronger and stronger, but it was still so goooood. I remember me telling it several times « haaaa It's so gooood ». I felt like I would have been rolling in the « hand of God », I felt « Him » gently remodelling me, I was crying of love for my friends, thinking to those, addicted to heroin, and I found something which cures it! I wanted to give them some, to go back to the seller buy other mushrooms and give them to my friends. Levels of energy flooding in me were still stronger and stronger, I was progressively going through newer and higher states of consciousness and knowledge and then « It » talked to me (no words or sounds in my head but much like an insight, although it was a very different kind of insight compared to those I've had this night or other times) and It made me realise that I'm able of really more than I thought, that I know really much more than I thought (in entheogenic plants and their use), that I have to go on learning again and again about it, that I could help people with it. I felt that this  presence was very gentle and only want good things to me, It made me understand that I was not the same anymore, I died and was reborn. 

My life had took a new way

This lasted about 4 hours, around 4h o'clock in the morning I felt the effect of P. Tampanensis were going away, and I was more feeling the effects of the Hawaian mushroom. Strong on the body, big burst of very strong energy were coming up from my abdomen, I felt like somebody would have been crushing me in his hand (but no pain at all). I was sitting on my bed, moving, balancing like a cobra and moaning. It was pushing very strong,  and I was not feeling so clearminded anymore (phil. St. Were really off). The rushes were hard on the body, but it was only rushes, no effects associated with it. Although those rushes, I felt that the journey was finished so I decided to go to sleep. At the very moment I closed my eyes, I was sleeping.

The day after, I woke up feeling very mind-cleared, although physically a hangover was present all the day and some again the other day after. 
But the energy wich was surrounding me that night was still here, I felt it him me and I still feel it more than one month after. It's not overpowering uncontrolable energy. It's a cool and positive one which gives me a lot more self confidence than I used to have, I'm filled with hapiness.,life and love are flooding in me it's the pure positive energy of LIFE I'm blessed with, so niiiiice. Total harmony with LIFE

The day after the journey, a fried of mine came to see me, and he proposed me some heroin, I refused it. And I refused again, several other times since, with absolutely no hesitation and no regret. I was still feeling physical withdrawal symptoms, but mentally it was sure over, NO MORE HEROIN, EVER ! ! !(2)

Because of the physical symptoms which were still disturbing, I had to take some buprenorphine (very , very little doses), but this I wanted to stop it again. I went back to Dutchland 3 weeks after this journey and bought some other Phil. Stones. There I took half a dose (6-7 grams fresh) alone. It was still very cool, great mind clarity, but (sure) less stronger. Eye closed imagery was really beautifull (3) . But it was more a recreationnal trip as I wanted it to be, I spend most of the journey hitting the streets of the Red Light District. The day after, I didn't felt the need to take some buprenorphine and I didn't want to take some. The other days were the same, it was finally over. I needed no more buprenorphine. I was free of dope, finally.

I was trying to quit dope from the beginning of the year (5 months), but all my friends are in the dope, and it's very difficult to refuse dope when some body give you some. But i had the will to quit dope, I really wanted to stop, and « psilohuasca » gave me the necessary mentally strength to do so, but I'm almost sure that it acted on a biological level too, but which one?

More than one month is gone since I stopped dope, I just took one time a line of heroin with some cocaine (4) , just to see how I would react. I used to LOVE Speedball. I enjoyed the effect, but as soon as the coke was off, BWARF, awfull, I sure didn?t enjoy the heroin effect, really. So it?s cool, don?t need it anymore, don?t LIKE it anymore !

I decided to test Phil . Stones on one of my addicted friends to verify wether it really cures (mentally, and biologically as it blew out my physical symptoms of addiction in two trial) from dope addiction (5) . It?s not the case. Even if he took out positive things from his journey (2.5 grams Peg. Harmala + 4 gr. Phil. Stones), even if he realised that heroin is big shit and that he had to stop, he?s still on heroin. He has not the strength to stop, and HE DOESN'T WANT TO ! ! !

I've ever had a lot of respect for those substances, but now I have far more respect for them, really.







Having felt the relatively mild effects of smoked salvia on several occasions, I decided to try a concentrated salvia extract. Over a month or so I took various amounts of it, both diluted and undiluted, with none giving any more of a buzz than when I'd smoked the salvia. Between this frustration at not achieving any 'better' results and my bad habit of doing potentially regrettable things on a whim, last night I decided to take a large dose and see what would happen.

I took 9 drops of diluted extract sublingually over the course of 12 minutes. I mixed the 3 drops of extract with approx. 1.5 drops of water in a shot glass, poured it in my mouth, waited 4 minutes, swallowed, and repeated twice more. As soon as the solution hit my tongue the alcohol began burning (it burns, badly, for about half a minute), although this time my mouth didn't begin salivating as much as it normally does. By the second shot glass my mouth was pretty much numb, and by the third the salvia had kicked in enough that I could barely figure out what was going on, let alone feel my tongue.

Somewhere during the course of the middle shot the salvia kicked in. With lower doses, the first signs of the salvia kicking in had always been the feeling that my head and upper torso were on fire, something between having a high fever and sweating profusely. This time it started as a tingle in my hands and feet, which slowly spread up through my body as the visuals (slight fish-eyed view, green and amber-red tint to everything) began. I was sitting in front of my computer at the time, and as the experience intensified the display began to take on 3-dimensional qualities, as if I could reach into it towards the open windows and such. This distracted me enough that I didn't notice how strongly the salvia had kicked in until I tried to take the third shot, which I had trouble doing (remembering what I was supposed to do became problematic). Once that was in my mouth I waited the remaining 4 minutes, swallowed, stood up...and reality went crazy.

(The following is my interpretation of the experience as I was coming down off the trip, after consensus reality had returned. I note this because this trip was *nothing* like LSD, Ketamine, or anything else I've experienced. Even the egoless, timeless environment of a K-Hole is more easily described than this. So, if something I say doesn't make total sense, that's why)

As I was standing up from my chair, I immediately felt that 'down' was to my left, and that the entire room was in essence on it's side. Even though I was standing on the wall (in my newfound reality), this seemed perfectly normal to me. Once I deemed this to be 'correct,' it was like it opened up my mind to even more of this strange new place. I knew I was in a garden, the idea of my room being enclosed was totally gone from my mind. My computer desk and its contents remained, but all the walls now extended outwards into a bright, very green garden with a white gazebo off to my left (which put it 'down' from me, with this entire place still being on the 'wall' I was standing on). It wasn't that I could actually see this so much as I just knew it was there, that this is where I was supposed to be, not my room. As the thought-idea of 'my room' went through my head, I seemingly pulled my consciousness back to consensus reality - I knew I was in my room, not a garden, and that 'down' was towards my feet and not to my left. This only lasted as long as I concentrated on staying grounded, however - as soon as I became comfortable with consensus reality I would again sink back into this new place.

Sometime during this I lay down on my bed, and turned the light off. In the darkness I was still in the garden - the perception of this new reality was the same no matter what physical conditions existed (light/dark, eyes open/closed). The only difference was now I felt like I was being pressed up against the bed, my feet facing 'down'. I spent some time amusing myself with the idea that this meant there were three types of gravity/force present, one holding me sideways, the other telling me where 'down' was, and the third keeping my bed in what I felt should be mid-air. My thoughts quickly changed to worrying that my roommate (who would freak out finding me in this condition) was about to come home, so I turned the lights back on, stood up, and walked out of my room (no idea why, it just seemed the logical thing to do at the time).

Walking seemed to keep me grounded in consensus reality, the only change being that the concept of right and left were a little confusing, and I knew that I wasn't judging the passing of time at all well - my bedroom clock said I'd only been tripping for a little over 5 minutes - seemed like forever. Since I had some time before my roommate arrived, I decided I'd go take a shower and go to bed, so I wouldn't have to deal with him. I walked into the bathroom, which brought my vision across a mirror.

Looking at my face, the first thing I noticed was the wide-eyed, blank/mindless look I had, which I took to be the 'scared animal face' I'd read about when going through salvia information. As I stood there looking at myself, I realized that I'd been mentally talking to myself this entire time, narrating what was going on as if I wasn't the person experiencing the trip. This made me wonder if I could physically talk at all, so I tried...but couldn't. I then commented to myself something like, 'heh, I guess the captain doesn't want to open my mouth. Oh well.'

Then it dawned on me that the person I was looking at *wasn't* me - somehow I existed as a separate entity from my body, which was floating/existing over my body's left shoulder. Analyzing this brought me to the strange situation I was currently in; I was somehow existing in 3 different places simultaneously, as a body, mind/consciousness (shoulder-entity), and spectator. My body was able to use all of its functions, but only if my consciousness decided to tell the body to do it, and the body decided to go along with entity's suggestion. The shoulder-entity, which seemed to equate to my consciousness, seemed to be performing 2 separate functions - commanding and narrating to my third-self. The third me was a spectator somewhere back and to my left, behind both the consciousness-me and the body-me. I'm not sure what it was for, but at the time I felt positive that even though I couldn't explain (to myself) what its purpose was, it was just as essential to 'me' as the other 2 parts were. As for who 'the captain' was, I'm still not sure - my consciousness was either referring to the spectator or to my body, although I have no clue which (I think I was talking to the spectator-me, but I was so confused by all this that I really didn't analyze any further). This whole situation began to make me feel panicky, as I realized I was actually perceiving everything from these three different locations simultaneously...something I couldn't even begin to comprehend despite the fact that I was doing it. This led to worries that I might continue to split up, causing my panic to grow.

In a smart move by the consciousness-me, I decided to busy myself by continuing to prepare to take a shower. I undressed down to my boxers, took my clothes out to the hamper in the kitchen, and returned to the bathroom successfully, sinking back into thought only once as I saw myself in the hallway mirror. It was like I was running on automatic, which I basically was - I've followed this exact procedure almost nightly for the last few years. I closed the bathroom door, removed my remaining clothing, went to the bathroom (really weird/disturbing experience, it felt like I was watching someone else go to the bathroom), and hopped in the shower.

I seemed to be coming down off the salvia trip at this point, as I was quickly feeling more like a single entity. I believe the water hitting me helped this, although staring at the far wall kept trying to draw me back into the sideways-gravity world (I kept thinking that wall was now 'down', and would then get stuck on the idea that this new 'down' was a different direction from the 'down' in my bedroom, even though they both existed in the same place/world/altered reality).

By the time I was done with the shower and in my bed, relaxed and comfortable, the salvia was mostly out of my system, holding on just enough to keep my mind wide awake. I went over the events in my mind, trying to get them sorted into a manner I'd be able to explain the following day (i.e. the above report). It took me the most time to figure out how to explain the triple-me incident, and by the time I was satisfied with my explanation/interpretation I was almost back to baseline and so drifted off to sleep.

Today I feel extremely awake and alert, way more than I should considering the amount of sleep I got. My tongue still feels burnt from the alcohol still, although it's not too bad. I really have no desire to experience this again soon, although I have no fears about it and most assuredly will sooner or later.















It started like any other day, just hanging out with my friends getting ready for a New Year's party.  We were all excited about it.  We weren't sure who'd be there and were surprised when we found out.  We arrived at the party and checked it out to see who was there.  We saw our friend, who we knew was heavily into drugs, and a couple of other people we recognized.  The party was getting started and we were ready to have fun so we got some beers, Boone's Farm, and Sevens.  It was great.  I started getting a little tipsy after a few drinks. Then I drank more and more until I was in total oblivion.  I had no idea what was going on.  The night was a blur, but I remember a little.  First, I walked in the kitchen and my druggy bud was snorting a line.  I asked her how to do it and she explained, so I tried. It tickled a little then I felt so good. It lasted for about 30 minutes. Then I wanted it more and more. I was ready to do anything for it.  By the end of the night I had snorted at least 6 lines that I remember. I probably did more than that but it isn't very clear to me. 

Snorting Cocaine was the biggest mistake of my young life.  If I hadn't felt so bad the next morning I would probably still do it.  Luckily, I didn't suffer anything unbearable. I know I will never do it again.








 [Erowid Note: 
Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe recreational use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.] 

I walked down to the local pharmacy and bought a can of that computer stuff in a bottle, the stuff that comes with the little red straw, and made my way back home.

I set up my pillow against the wall, and flipped the black light on, and there was music on the computer, and I laid back against the pillow on my bed, and two of my other friends were in the room. One was standing by the window, and the other sitting at the computer, conversing among themselves. Previously to this we had smoked a lot of Cannabis Sativa.

I broke open the bottle and huffed down a good bit, and set the bottle next to me on the ground and waited for it to kick in. Small flashing light spots, flashed in front of my eyes, and I lost motor skills and laid there staring. A strange radar-like sound echoed in my head, and I phased out, I would look at my friend standing, and I could only hear him talking, but I saw my sitting friend's lips moving. Then I glanced to my other friend, sitting, and I could only hear him talking, but they were talking faster, like on 2x speed on the tape recorder. I phased back in and the lightshow went away, but the noise echoed in my head, for a good six minutes afterwards.

Another different trip, same bottle, I was sitting on the ground in a doorway, and I huffed a good bit more than I had last time. When it kicked in, everywhere I glanced my head, I only had peripherial vision. All I saw was black where I couldn't see anything else. Then I had a vision of being on the beach with two other guys, and we were climbing a wall. And when I reached the top of the wall, I yelled, 'Come here, kitty' That's when I phased back in, and my friends had told me I had run after our pet cat screaming 'Come here, kitty' It was an intense ride.

The greatest part about Computer Duster is, it's cheap, and lasts awhile. Usually from $5.00 to $6.00 depending on your location.

The downside is, you have to let it warm up after every few huffs or else the Nitrous gas inside will freeze your lungs internally, says so right on the label, and I'm not one for caution, but I take that seriously









I would like to share a mescaline trip I had the other day.  I thought it would be best to write this fresh after the experience occurred, two days ago on October 27th 1999. I am going to give you the most accurate depiction of what this substance is going to put you through for a good 10 to 15 hours, that I feel I can describe accurately

Background information on myself 60: 190 pounds.  I have been doing drugs for seven years now, call it a death trap if you will.  Death is what I feel many drugs have caused me, nothing but burned an empty hole in my pocket and my soul.  It seems nearly everyone I know ends up either in prison or dead as a result of drugs, which is why I have given up the more destructive addictive substances.  Enough of this however right, as if we havent heard this speech before?  Oh well, I hope people use drugs and find out where they will take them, its your path and your choice and nobody should be able to inhibit this.  In fact some of the smartest people I know use drugs, but unfortunately, it is all for the selfish or hedonistic reasons.  Let us just hope people dont do what they do best with drugs and all other things in life, overindulge them (human nature let us not forget).  And you say its only a western thing!  I say its a human thing.  Only after some of my harder mescaline trips do I really start to question myself and my role in life.  Only after I have spent a good 10 hours of thinking do I really begin to understand the JUST THE QUESTIONS to some of the philosophical beliefs I stated above.  

I have used acid 35-45 times, shrooms 30 times, San Pedro 30 times, Peruvian torch 15 times, you get the idea.  These are the more classic psychedelics your probably going to run into.  Ive done everything else on the side as well, coke, glass, smack, DMT. 

These drugs all are unique and interesting in their own way, but most get old fast.  For this reason, I stick to psychedelics.  I have discovered nothing, and learned nothing from these other substances other than how to obtain them on the streets, abuse them, and add more paranoia to my life than need be.

If a strong source of mescaline is to be desired your best off getting peyote or T. Peruvians.  Out of all of the T. Pachanoi I have tried, only one was as potent as the weakest Peruvians I have tried.  This is from my own personal experience and is as accurate over the past 3 years as I remember.  I have tried over 10 different kinds of San Pedro.  Your most magical San Pedro specimens are dark green (and yes the yellow ones arent as good in my opinion, iron deficiency perhaps?) they are taller and older.  But it varies from place to place, climate to climate.  I have tried the Ancash, and two other unknown varieties of T. Peruvianus.  The T. Peruvianus is common here in the southwest if you go to the right nursery.  VERY thick, sometimes up to 8 inches from rib to rib.  I remember seeing a large 6 by 6 foot specimen in Balboa Park in San Diego, quite beautiful.  6 inches of this cactus always seems to get me where 2 to 3 feet of San Pedro would.  Since it is hardier, and can take harsher drier environments, I would imagine it has a higher mescaline content.  This only makes sense because it can endure temperatures of under 15 to 20 F unlike (depends on strain)  20 to 26 F for San Pedro (so far as I have observed) and is more drought tolerant than Pedro, which might be why it seems to be more potent (on average for myself).

To prepare the cactus I would suggest not extracting it (pain), not cooking it for hours on end (messy pain), and not eating it fresh (disgusting slimy pain).  The BEST method in my opinion is to dry the cactus in the dark for a week or two.  The sun does degrade it, as I have tried the same specimen sun-dried and noticed a significant decline in quality. The more heat you apply the more you break down and degrade any chemical,think about it?   Preparing it in this manner, helps ensure that you will eat as much of the good stuff as possible without minimal loss from the sun or by boiling water.  Also when stuffed into capsules you dont have to taste the horrible stuff, which alone can make you gag on the spot.

I ended up drying 2 feet of T. Peruvians cactus over a week in the dark.  I than ground it up and stuffed it into 95...0 gelatin capsules which came out to over 65 grams (less than I thought) dry. FAR TO MUCH, as I was soon to find out in the upcoming hours!  Most of the T. Peruvians trips Ive had have been about 50 capsules dry, and San Pedro about 120 capsules, this would be good for an average person in my best judgment. But for some reason, this night I was feeling adventurous.

I took the pills at 12:30 am, by 12:40 I had consumed all of them.  When I eat capsules, I can stuff about 3 at a time down my throat so it goes by much quicker.  I do not recommend this however, as you will almost definitely get sick from eating this many in such a short period of time. The first effects werent noticed until about 30 minutes later.  I noticed as I was sitting on the bed thinking about my life, I noticed a gradual alteration in my perception. This alteration is not really noticeable to a great degree, and many people probably wouldnt notice it.  It feels like you know something is soon going to happen, and sight takes on a new depth (very gradual).  About an hour into the experience obvious effects are felt, a slight body high which starts to take on waves of euphoria, tingles & chills might soon follow down the spine.  I remember I  started to feel like my worries were slipping away.  I felt like a serene natural flow of energy had overwhelmedt my entire body.  This feeling of peacefulness soon started to grow in intensity, and the visual hallucinations soon persisted.  The first notations in the visual department are almost like a rippling of perception, like everything is shaking in small jitters.  The first visual occurrences are rather weak and minute.  It doesnt seem like the peak experience comes for at least 4 to 5 hours after the drug has been taken.  The period in-between the come-on and the peak was just a gradual buildup of energy with minor visuals (tracers, waves, flickers of light).  Flickers of light radiating off of objects, are the most noticeable.  Unlike
acid or shrooms, mescaline has more of a body high that has a peaceful quality you wont find with either of the two  Acid tends to come on quickly and terrifies me.  It seems like every thought or feeling I have is intensified to the point where I feel like I will loose it at the spot and go crazy.  Acid is a very tense and rushed intense altered state.  With acid thoughts come and go so rapidly that it is hard to focus on any one thing.  And if one does manage to focus on one distinct thing it seems almost like it is forced into the mind.  I often feel like I have very little control over what thoughts will come and go into my mind on acid.  Shrooms are fun and have a unique body high unlike that of acid or mescaline. Definitely has a sort of weak tryptamine feeling which I moderately enjoy.  Shrooms seem to have more of a head high than a body high.  They make you feel happy and giddy, yet at the same time lethargic and unmotivated.  Mescaline will have more of a stimulating quality to it which is more manageable in my mind than acid or shrooms.  It isnt as speedy and mind crackling as acid, and it doesnt have the dreamy tendencies many people complain of on shrooms.  However, mescaline can make you feel very stimulated/irritated and shaky.  I often feel like at points I want to sit down but would rather stand up, if I chose to stand up I would want to sit down, sort of leaves your body confused at points, sort of edgy like speed in some VERY distant ways.

Visually mescaline can be quite spectacular on higher doses, rivaling all hallucinogens Ive tried excluding DMT.  I have noticed with acid, visuals come on suddenly and quickly.  They come and go so quickly that your mind does not have a chance to build up a very large visual display, or something with bulk so to say.  Acid has much more finely tuned geometric patterns than mescaline, and does seem to portray more sharp, lined, structured hallucinations.  Mescaline has a more natural feel, reminiscent of naturally occurring things you might come across.  I often notice large spheres, spiderweb designs, and splashy patterns that seem to come and go much like acid but in longer intervals.  Visuals on mescaline are more naturally structured and seem to take longer to form than visuals on acid, but when they do they are more discernible.  I have noticed actual figures or images of figures on mescaline that resemble living things on my higher Peruvians journeys.  I have never seen a true hallucination on acid, and I have taken in excess of 12 hits before (7 hits and your legally insane BULL), if thats the case I should have been locked up years ago).  I have only seen on acid or any hallucinogen, very precise hallucinations geometric patterns, heavily exaggerated figures and distortions in weight and size.  Undulations or ripples in objects are also present, but little to nothing more.  With mescaline I have seen all of these things, but they seem to not be on the large/intense magnitude of acid.  However, I have noticed large figures that form, more bulky and larger hallucinations, they do come few and far between as opposed to acid or shrooms, but they are more spectacular in my mind.  Shrooms seem to have a dreary sort of visual quality.  Shrooms distort objects much better than acid or mescaline and seem to be a little more colorful than the two.  Facial expressions, body proportion, weight, and motor coordinations seem to be more unstable and wobbly than acid or mescaline. Shrooms are sort of like being thrown into a Peewees playhouse episode, running around laughing and jumping & acting uninhibited, acid is like being thrown into a bright intense Japanese anime cartoon where you have no idea what is going on (if your American of course), and mescaline would be like being thrown into Scooby Doo.....theres a mystery to be solved, an adventure underway, an elaborate expedition. 

Oh yeah as for my trip I should get back to that.  Anyway after about 1 hour the stimulating qualities seemed to subside.  It was if the visual qualities were coming into play and balancing out the aphrodisiac qualities.  I would also like to add mescaline is one of the best aphrodisiacs I have EVER done, rivaling acid and ecstasy by far.  Imagine
combining acid/ecstasy than throwing a more focused sexual energy or drive if you will into the equation, and you have mescaline.  As for my state of mind,  I would notice consciousness seemed to move incredibly slow almost to the point where I lost all concept of time (which never happens to me on acid or shrooms).  An hour on this drug felt literally like 2 or 3 hours, Im not kidding.  This trip was different from most of my lighter 40 gram Peruvianus trips.  It was much more distinctive of the mescalines effects, and the various stages I seem to go through on it.  Ive never had a trip come on in 30 to 45 minutes ever on this drug, but I had eaten a small meal prior to the pill consumption. Perhaps the digestive acid helped break down the cactus tissue and release it into my system faster than normal?   since I consumed the capsules in 10 minutes? who knows? 

Unlike with shrooms or acid, you will RARELY know when if EVER at what point the peak comes or goes.  You can usually only gauge it based on what facts and documents state about the drug and its duration period.  The drug is so slow and soothing, yet shaky and restless its almost always impossible to notice the transition point.  You will know for sure when you peak but it will be hard to distinguish the transition.  I always peak about the 4th hour + in.  Visual hallucinations are prevalent in almost every object you look at.  Objects contract and enlarge, rich REDS & GREENS predominately engulf my peripheral vision.  Red & Green seem to be the predominate colors of acid and mescaline in my opinion, mainly RED.

When the peak finally hit, I walked away from the computer, than over to the bed, feeling very stimulated 4 1/2 hours in.  THIS IS WHERE THE HEALING OCCURED for myself.  I was lying on the bed observing my hand.  It was so cool watching the little red and green lights grow and contract all over my fingers, like ivy vines growing up and down a tree trunk and its branches.  I could even see the aura around my hand, it was something like a force field but you couldnt see it, you just knew it was there.  I remember looking up at the stucco ceiling briefly.  Large waves of red engulfed my room. I even remember at one point noticing the outline of a red plane with a propeller headed toward me for a split second.  Not a true hallucination (I have yet to see one) but probably one of the closest things.  

After about 20 minutes of observation I started to feel terribly sick.  I could feel my mouth salivating and preparing for the dreaded ritualistic vomiting ceremony I have quickly grown used to from these trips.  I truly wanted to puke my guts up to the fullest.  I wanted the sickness to leave me, I wanted to feel the stimulating qualities overwhelm me once again, I wanted to enjoy the rest of the trip.  But something wouldnt let me.  I soon felt this horrible feeling of guilt overwhelm me.  I started to feel like I once again abused another drug, detracted from its purpose, neglected myself.  These feelings always come to me at one point or another on a mescaline trip.  I quickly got up and attempted to walk to the bathroom.  I feared confronting my fears, which in my mind is the only way you can have a bad or good trip on mescaline (all depends on how you use it).  I didnt feel ready to think about my life and where it was headed, but I swear to God it was like my entire consciousness was now centered on the pain in my life and I wouldnt be able to avoid it. When I did manage to get up I quickly felt my mouth salivating and I knew I would puke. I went over to the toilet and stood over it for over 10 minutes hopping the pain would go away, but it didnt.  I continued to feel crap and no matter what I did I couldnt puke, so I just went ahead and drank 1/4 a bottle of Pepto Bismo and headed back to the bed.  At least if I wasnt going to puke I was going to make damn sure I wouldnt have to get back up for a few more hours.  

The nausea was excruciating, my sides both hurt, my left side in particular.  All I could do was huddle into the fetal position and lie there helpless for the next 5 hours, I was in hell.  Funny, just 1 hour ago I was in heaven, price to pay perhaps? Those five hours truly gave me many more issues to think about than all my other psychedelic experiences combined.  I questioned so many things, and while I didnt get the answers to a lot of the questions, I at least understood the questions now better than I ever did before.  As a result, I feel much stronger after that experience.  Now I at least can ask myself the questions and Ill have this experience to think back on as a reminder for future self-destructive actions.  

For as much pain as I endured that time period from about 3 to 8 a.m. about an hour or so after the sun came up, I feel like I now know what the healing process is truly all about.  I now feel like I have a grasp on what true physical pain is, and how to avoid it next time at least.  After about 8 a.m. the effects were still strong, obvious tracers, colors, distortions, but I was definitely out of the peak.  Words cant describe what I went through in that five hours, the most unbearable physical Nausea I have ever endured, the most amazing real time closed eye visuals Ive ever had (although I might have drifted in and out of sleep for short periods, but I do remember feeling very restless and not being able to sleep.  I had my eyes closed for 5 hours and STILL dont remember falling asleep.  I remember seeing visions (sounds corny as shit I know) but I swear there were points where I saw true visions of ideas and thoughts and theories form, all of which I vaguely remember.  As for the nausea, it subsided around 11 or 12 in the afternoon.  I had some college classes I had to attend at 12:30 that day.  I decided to walk to school and enjoy the serenity.  After my first period class, the effects were gone completely. 

I couldnt eat for another 12 hours, I had no desire in doing so. My stomach felt severely bloated for the entire day. The highlight of the comedown however was the walk to school.  It was quite amazing getting outside, especially after dwelling in what seemed like 10 hours of painful darkness (only 4 or 5 in reality though).  If all my times dont quite add up or sound accurate, it really is due to time lapses and stand stills that seemed to occur throughout the entire experience.  I really felt alive after that experience, regardless of the nausea I loved the entire thing and I would most certainly relive all of it again.  I see pain now as a blessing.  I truly feel like mescaline is the virtue of hallucinogens, all others seem like a vice to me.  It has every element that I am after.  I
love the different gradual stages I go through.  Although the Nausea is sometimes prevalent in some of my trips, I have found that my most adventurous trips NEED nausea for me to accept what Im doing to my body.  This drug almost keeps me guided at times, making me question so much about myself and the stupid actions I take.  I often dwell on those thoughts for days after and try to avoid those actions.  For anyone that says hallucinogens are mind expanding I agree in minor ways.  I think to many people including myself, most of the time say this for an excuse to escape reality.  Im not going to bullshit people and tell them this crap about how hallucinogens have changed my life and I am enlightened above all others.  I pity people that make those statements.  Sounds like
someone with poor selfworth that feels they need to feel special and above others to make them happy.  If you were happy, social hierarchical status would not matter, nor would fancy material possessions, nor would you go out of your way to please others (codependency) or victimize others (sociopathy) Sorry if this applies to you but it applies to me, and we are all human arent we, so....Contradict myself you say?  Well proves my point about human nature doesnt it.  

I think hallucinogens dont enlighten anyone or do anything of that nature. Hallucinogens simply take out the filters of your brain and allow you to focus more clearly on your current situation and how to change, help, fix, solve, understand, grow from it.  They also offer great artistic qualities, which we all know of.  TRUE ENLIGHTENMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE DRUGS, JUST A STATE OF MIND, which is why I think that anyone who says they need drugs to find enlightenment sounds like they are looking for something more that they have yet to find?  I truly do think that ultimate enlightenment comes with living a prosperous virtuous morally structured lifestyle, THAT IS ENLIGHTENMENT, and no drug can provide this, or mimic this, it comes from your heart.  I won't label a drug something it is not, nor will I put a positive label on something based on its immediate over long term effects. I know I have offended some people, think about what you say before you say it, that is probably one of our biggest mistakes in this society, People don't realize what they are saying anymore.  

What I have stated is to my knowledge either factly based on my own personal observations, or opinion based on mindsets I deal with around  people I run across in the counterculture, make that culture in general period....

BOTTLE LINE:  Mescaline feels like combining a couple hits of acid with 2 hits of ecstasy for most of you mainstreamers out there, be smart, and have fun.







so it all began while i was in london. i called my roommate and she told me that she owed me an apology but wouldn't tell me why. when i got home i understood. i had tried cocaine for the first time on spring break  and she bitched me out for doing it. i said i'd never snort anything. i'd done all the basics except coke, crack, and heroin. that was the only time i did it.

fast-forward--my friend was talking about an apology because she had done it. right before i left to go to europe, we met a bunch of new guys. little did i know we would have soo much in common and they would introduce new world's to us....  my friend(let's call her beth) didn't just snort it, she shot it up or rigged it as we call it. when i got back, i also rigged cocaine for the first time. don't let anyone tell you different--that is the way to do cocaine. it is the most intense feeling one could ever have. i never got the 'wa wa's' the first 10 or 12 times i shot up.  but the first time i did, just imagine the feeling: it hits your vien, there's  about 3 seconds of waiting and then everything around starts to sound metallic. if water is running that's the most metallic sound. everything sounds like luke skywalker is right beside you twirling his lightsaver.

Wanting to get the wa wa's made my boyfriend and i almost break up, i lied to evryone, i was broke, lying to dealers, and i lost 4 jobs while i was behaving this way.there were 5 of us at the beginning of the railroad to hell and we introduced it to about 15 other people. let me tell you what happened: one of them went to rehab and my roommate and best friend, beth had to move back home to her parents house to get away. then there's the reason i stopped rigging, my friend that almost died. 

After being up on crystal meth all night, my b-friend and i came home. ten minutes after we got there my neighbor came running screaming on my door that some guy a couple of doors down was screaming that he had a blod clot and was about to die. this is one of the original five people and also my neighbor. i ran down there and had to hold a clot on my fried's left side of his chest while he sceamed that he was about to die and i had to save his life. I took one look at his arms and i had to run to the bathrrom and throw-up. he had track marks all the way up his arms. i couldn't handle that. 911 had already been called but weren't there. i tried and tried to hold that knot but it kept moving and we were both frantic. i mean--i couldn't sit there and i couldn't really help him. i don't know if you can imagine but try to. my very good friend was about to die and i couldn't really do anything for him. and worst of all it could have been me. that's the day i stopped shooting up. 

oh i failed to mention, my friend had already had 2 siezures and hadn't learned his lesson. oh, and after this incident, he still shoots up to this day. stupid bastard. i can't be his friend anymore because if he doesn't give a fuck about his life. i care whether i live or die; he doesn't. you see, all you people who think your addicted to snorting coke, try shooting it. you find a whole new world of addiction. i woulndn't do it again if my life depended on it. you can take what you want from this article--i left out all the basic , normal coke head stuff: getting more at noon the next day, going on 2 day binges, having to get drunk to sleep--that's basic. 

i still snort occasionally but not much. i relized how fucked up i was. i'd come home every morning after be out all night and cry to my boyfriend and tell him it was the last time. i'd stay out all night with my dealer--what must have gone on in my boyfirnd's head i don't even want to know. 









 [Erowid Note: 
Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe recreational use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.] 

It is really hard here (Utah) to find good drugs.  Marijuana is ample but I prefer acid (which seems extinct).  My friend told me of his gasoline huffing experiences.  I was curious to do this, so, after my friend told me the best way to huff up the fumes, I went home and tried it.  I'm telling you now how dumb it is. I went with my friend's 'coke bottle' idea (put just a small ring of gasoline at the bottom of a 2 liter bottle, put your mouth on the bottles mouth and inhale).  I did this a couple times in the garage (alone).  My first huffs.  I felt my head sink into my body so I thought I had no neck, like wise with my eyes.  I huffed a bit more.  My impaired judgement told me to do this in the house, downstairs.  Like a dumb-ass I did. I huffed more and more.  I looked at the wall in between rounds.  The oddest pattern.  It was purple and yellow, 60's psychedelic art; it was spinning in circles, slowly and tranquil.  I sat on the couch awed with a gas bottle in my lap.  I inhaled more and more, seeing how close I can come before insanity and melting my brain.  

I thought the computer a couple feet away from me was helping with the nuke job (I had to find a new seat away from the computer.).  Finally, I was so completely gone (not the good gone, but awake nightmares about myself as a child) I actually started drinking gas!  Like I said, it was in a 2 liter bottle so subconciously I thought it was soda or something.  I passed out.  
I had this nightmare about me back 10 years ago when I was 3 or 4.  From the sins I did god decided to punish me.  He threw a beehive from the purple and black heavens.  It hit me in the mouth.  The juice of the beehive got all over my face and stung!  It stung so bad!  I woke up later, and, come to find out, I had actually still been drinking the gasoline while I was passed out!  The beehive in my nightmare was actually the 2 liter bottle and all the gasoline spilled out onto my face.  That was what was stinging!  I looked at the couch I was sitting on.  It was drenched on the front side.  I figured it was the spilled gasoline or my vomit (both I find out).  

I'm still too fucked up to clean it up or to do anything about it.  I heard my dad walk into the house upstairs, home from work.  I had the sense to hide the bottle behind a different couch.  I sat on the rocking chair and turned the TV on.  I was rocking gently back and forth (I actually wasn't, the gasoline makes you feel like ya are.).  I forgot my dad was upstairs.  A couple minutes later, I turned my head to the left.  There he was.  He was screaming at me, asking me why the house stunk like gas.  I hurry and ditched upstairs.  He followed me.  I took a seat on the kitchen table realizing if I left he would probably tackle me in the street and drag me home.  After he calmed down a little I constructed enough words (and brain cells) to tell him that I was lighting gas on fire outside and it must of got on my shoes.  Him, being an adolescence himself, didn't believe me and stormed downstairs looking for evidence that I was inhaling.  Thank the god who pegged me with that beehive, he didn't.  He left back to work and I, coming down, cleaned up my mess.  He still doesn't beleive me I don't think, but he hasn't disowned me (not yet). 
 
If there is anybody who is reading this who is planning on huffing gas, I say that experimenting is good, but only once or twice-after that you lose reality and you're incapable of thinking; seriously, the friend who taught me how to do the two liter bottle trick is completely gone mentally. 

I went through hell that experience.....not really hell but mental deterioration.  It took a couple days to straighten out who I was. When I passed out I honestly thought I was 3 again!  I came to (after the beehive) and for a couple of minutes, thought I was 20+ years in the future!  Besides that one hallucination, it was not psychedelic, thus, I don't recommend it. Psychedelic is latin for mind-altering.  What is latin for mind-melting?







I bought an ounce of salvia a few months ago and have tried it several times but I have had to stop my research on it due to its utterly confusing effects. I have only had one experience with it where it actually produced any sort of visions, but the rest of the experiences were all pretty much the same. 

What happens is, first I break out in a hot prickly sweat, and then suddenly I become extremely irritated, agitated, cranky, and generally unhappy! So much so that I usually have to stop smoking the stuff, because it would only be more painful to continue. Small amounts produce only these effects. Larger amounts often make me feel a strong 'presence' with me (like the plant is inside my head, but not really talking to me), and it is in this stage that I usually end up saying with passion, 'Ouch! Why are you doing this to me? What the hell are you doing?' The slight pain and discomfort are usually accompanied with a strong sense of confusion (often, the pain and discomfort are the very thing I am confused about; i.e., 'why the hell are you hurting me?') It very much feels like Salvia is playing with me, almost. Every time I ask it why it's hurting me, it doesn't answer, and eventually the effects subside.

My one intense experience was a one-hit full bong load while on mushrooms. This was also accompanied by a great discomfort, although there was also a legion of elves and a four-foot witch that came out of a nearby oak tree that was attacking me with a scythe or sickle. This time the experience was accompanied with a sense of panic, although not at any particular thing; I was not afraid of the things I was seeing, or of anything at all, yet I was panicked.

What is confusing to me is why most people seem to have very positive experiences with Salvia, while it only seems to make me very physically uncomfortable and agitated. If anybody has any suggestions or insights, they would be very helpful! This has been bothering me for months now, and it's a tad frustrating having a bag of Salvia but not being able to reap its reported benefits.











I'd chipped around with coke, but until I'd injected some, I'd never known its complete effects.  Injecting coke is completely different than snorting.  I've heard that smoking crack is similar, the same tinnitus (ringing in the ears), but I've never gotten that high off smoking, nor trusted anyone who could score that urban trash, nor liked having to score the way crackheads score--one piece at a time.  I'd done time in prison for psilocybin, so my connections were good.  I prefered to score an ounce at at a time, sell off my cost plus a slight profit.  Then, I'd acquire a box of fresh needles, sterile cotton balls, distilled water, and a clean spoon. 

Shooting coke is a progressive vice.  When you're young, stupid, and the coke's good, a very little amount will send you over the edge.  As your tolerance builds, and your experience in the altered universe of coke dementia increases, one finds themselves able to quell the panic of immediate onset.  The rush of a fresh shot insights panic to the layman; but the experienced user wants to ride the cliff, to risk missteping into overdose.  To hear the 'train', the aluminum sound of the world being crushed--like the 'green room' of surfing, the sound of water on fire with the tap running slightly in the bathroom.  To look at death, to think that if I just stop concentrating, I might die; that's the buzz.  It's the urban shaman, the risk of death....stupid and exhilarating.  

I don't recommend shooting ANYTHING...to anyone.  First, it's bad karma.  Secondly, I'd hate to condemn someone else to the craving nightmares and the sick game of wanting something SO EMPTY.  I know that, regardless, some will push the envelope and want to try 'The Forbidden'.  So, all those other little rich kids (you know who you are), at least follow these rules if you're going to do it:

1.  Fresh needles.  One use and then bend the needle, recap and put in an empty liquid detergent container that will be duct-taped later so some poor guy, only doing his job, won't get a bad surprise.

2.  If possible, try it with an experienced user.  

3.  Try a test shot before trying to 'shoot the moon.' Why overdose when the second shot can be The Shit?

4.  Don't turn anyone on.  The first 20 times you do it, you think you've found something great that the world should know about.  If there was ever a forbidden fruit that most people should avoid, it's this bullshit.  Don't turn Suzy Sorority girl on to it either; she'll get busted and narc, overdose and die, or whore herself for a hit....who needs the hassle?










I am a college student at Case Western, probably the most boring place in the world, and so one day, me and a friend decided to drink a bottle of cough syrup in an attempt to get fucked up.  We went to the store and looked at all the different types and found the one that contained the highest concentration of DXM, and didn't have anything else in it.  At about 6:30, I poured the whole bottle in a cup, closed my nose and pounded it down.  It wasn't as bad as I had expected, but the aftertaste was terrible and I couldn't get rid of it with cigarettes or alcohol.  After an hour or so, it started to kick in, so I decided to play some playstation to pass the time.  I began to get more and more fucked up.  I had techno playing on my computer with visualization effects, and the music sounded so good and the  visuals looked so cool.  It was too distracting and I had to stop playing playstation and went to see my friend who was almost passed out and neither of us could walk very well.

Later on (I totally lost all concept of time), another friend came down and we smoked some bong hits, and the weed made the visuals kick in.  Everything started moving with wave-like motion, and it was nearly impossible to concentrate on anything.  I think I staggered around the dorm for a while and everyone who saw me said I looked more fucked up than they had ever seen anyone.  Finally, at 12:30 or 1, I laid down and found it surprisingly easy to fall asleep.  The next day I was very groggy and felt kind of stupid, but nothing like the night before.  I have done just about all the drugs there are, and I have to say that one five dollar bottle of cough syrup from the grocery store fucked me up more than anything else I have ever done.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to trip.  I thought it was better than acid, because it was less of a mind fuck and wasn't so goddamn hard to get to sleep on.








I decided to brew some absinthe, me and my friend made two different concotions to see if there was any difference.  First concotion was vodka (80 proof) with wormwood, sugar, lemon peels and prickly lettuce.  We mashed up all the herbs placed them into the bottle and let them sit for two days.  The second concotion contained just wormwood, and vokda (80 proof).  We drank one shot each the first one two day later at 3 a.m on night, It began to feel like a real bad valuim high.  I was sitting my couch and felt like I was melting into the couch, I had work the next morning and lied down into bed.  Next thing I know the I was conscience but the room seamed like outer space.  I finally woke up, having no idea what happened the night before.  My friend had the same experience, confusion, delirum, sudden sleep. We both talked the next day and keeply felt like we had a psychodelic episode (Or perhaps a lack of sleep).  

8 days later, we decided to pour a large shot of both concotions, instead of a valuim feeling it hit us really quick and short.  It felt like a quick speedy high, really wierd.  I couldn't talk right or anything, just kept rambling on.   If anyone else tries any of these, good luck, We definitely were fucked up.








After careful research and a desire to get fucked up, I finally tried Diphenhydramine HCL.  I bought some generic allergy medicine for a local store ($2.29).  The pack contained 24 pills, I took 10 total.  I did it last night at midnight and I felt pretty normal by 9 AM.

Until now, I had thought that DXM was the most powerful OTC I had been using.  I have a friend who orders the powder and I have done up to 1500 mg of DXM, which was pretty weird.  I had the out-of-body experience and all of the experiences associated with it...I have done DXM on and off for about 3 years.  I play it smart though and don't overstep my bounds.  I typically do ~1000 mg...now on to my point. 

The Dyphenhydramine HCL is a pretty potent drug.  I had actual hallucinations such as people, posters laughing, walking soda cans that sprouted legs, and if I am not mistaken I think I even saw Marlon Brando.  My point is that I never truly hallucinated before this.  I have tripped on LSD about 35-40 times, DXMed probably around 100, and so on...but the pseudo-hallucinations of DXM do not even compare.  You literally cannot distinguish from fact or fiction on Dyphenhydramine HCL.  I thought it would be an utterly exciting experience...but it wasn't.

I have always wanted to hallucinate my whole drug life (7 years), and I craved to see if I could handle the distortions of reality.  I always wanted to test the validity and strength of my mind...but they failed.  I was scared, very scared.  While tripping, I crawled into bed and begged for it to stop.  I didnt feel sick that much, but I just wanted things back to normal.  Diphenhydramine HCL is scary.  I never get scared (honestly).  Last night I could not tell what was happening.  I thought my room was on fire and I almost woke up my roommate to get out of the building.  I saw smoke.  When I waved my hand, it looked IDENTICAL to real smoke.  Scary.
 
I did not have a tripsitter.  If you want to do Diphenhydramine HCL, fine go ahead.  It is your sanity.  However, all in all it was THAT bad.  At least not as bad as some people's experiences.  Stick with DXM no more than twice a month or less, and just keeping enjoying life.  I am almost done with college (tier 1 school), so I have to grow up before society catches up with me.








hil and me have always been into drugs, but for the longest time we had really chilled on it. but now it was different, it was summer and we didn't have to be around all the people who made it so we had to chill. we went to this dance club for people 21 and under, after, we hooked up with some of our guys friends and a couple of more chicks. we ended up behind this group of stores, everyone there was on acid, cranc, they were drunk..you name it and it was there.

well these other girls showed up, and hil and me just clicked with them. we spent about a week with them non-stop before they took us to party with 'their croud'. at first we kinda nervous, i mean these people were gang members; not that hil and me weren't use to gangs, we were, but we had never met these guys before. anyways...one of them pulled out a huge sack of buds, so for bout an hour we smoked bud non-stop. but hil, april (one off those girls we ment), and me were getting bored, this weeed was killing our 'tweekyness'. for the past week all we had done was cranc, weed was bringing us down. finally april told this guy named jon to pull out the heavy shit, so he did. for the next 8 hours we sat in that house smoking and snorting lines of cocaine and cranc. 

hil smoked more because that was how she was taught, but i felt weird smoking it 'cause i never really did. we were so spun after about an hour that we just sat there on this girl's couch smoking about 2 packs of cigs, just staring. we couldn't talk, ever time we looked at each other we would just smile. jon was going crazy because we wouldn't talk to him. we didn't not talk to him on purpose, we tried, well at least i did. when we finally left it was about ten in the morning, we had arived at like 8:30 or 9:00pm. damn time really flew by that night. anyways..later when i had to be home by myself for a little while, while every one went home to take a shower i started to come down because i started to get really ancy. everything was making me nervous. i felt like complete shit within an hour, and all i remeber of that time is sitting out in my drive-way on the phone with my good pal nikki, and brian cryen' so hard. i never wanted to go through that again. no words can explain that feeling. i had come down before but this...this was too much. 
that was 5 months ago, today i'm back at my mom's house far way from hil for the school year for different reasons, and now with my new pal jamie i am still doing coke and crank. i know it is wrong but i love it. i just hate coming down, so i never let myself. someday this is gonna catch up to me, i know that too, but for now i am stuck. so to all you out there i give you this piece of advice...go ahead and TRY it, but make sure you level yourself. don't get caught in it... the 'speed lane' really isn't that great. i don't care who you are. i live the 'speed lane' and it really sucks dick.









I became interested in mycology (the study of mushrooms)this past year, and experimented with psilocybin mushrooms at various points.  However, I got a sudden interest in taking Amanita after reading accounts of Siberian shamans uses of the shrooms.  I found a patch growing in some woods near my house, and dried two mushrooms from that patch.  I went to work and found a friend there who would be willing to experiment with me.  We both ate one mushroom; the initial effects were nothing more than nausea and an energy boost.  These, however, passed within thirty minutes.  Nothing followed.  We were both perplexed, and I became terrified at the prospect of having picked the wrong shrooms (a potentialy fatal mistake; be careful picking your own!).  After two hours, I was sitting in the break room reading a magazine when IT happened.

As I tried to focus on the words on the pages of the magazine, my vision became distorted.  I realized that I was unable to read - whenever I looked directly at a word, it would disappear!  I went out and found my friend, who was also feeling a little trippy at this point.  The effects increased, and after an hour, anything I looked at directly would dissolve into microscopic cubes of various colors.  Nothing greater than this sensation took place.  I came home with a strange body feeling and went to sleep.  There were no ill effects, but I wouldn't recommend using the mushroom to anyone.  The trip simply isn't that...well...trippy.








Weight does not seem terribly important for LSA.  Over the years, much 'gobbledygook' has been posted on the 'net regarding the psychedelic potential of morning glory seeds. More often than not, one reads of procedures varying from simple water soaking to more involved alkaloid extractions involving polar and non-polar solvents and such. This is all tedious and unnecessary. Though such extractions have the potential for success if one is careful and starts with about twice as many seeds as they need to get off (such extractions are usually very inefficient), it's a waste of time.

The benefit of a successful extraction is that the intensity of the negative side effects (nausea, diarrhea, and with repeated use, sometimes leg cramps) can be significantly reduced. As a trade-off, the resulting trip is often less intense. Nevertheless, the negative side effects are overstated. The truth is, for most people they approach the unbearable only with excessive dosage (beyond 250 seeds) and/or excessive frequency of use (more than twice a month).

If you wanna get off on morning glory seeds, all you have to do is take four packages (typically weighing 1.5g each and containing about 60 seeds--this should suffice for anybody), CHEW THEM TO A PASTE AND SWALLOW. That's all there is to it my friends--that's all you have to do. Throw that petroleum ether away for chrissakes! Zippo lighter fluid? Please! Just chew 'em and swallow--BOY will you be glad you did. First-timers will be amazed at the intensity and similarity to acid of this legal and easily obtainable psychedelic. No, it is not as good as LSD, but if nothing else is available, it is a reasonable approximation of one to two hits of acid. 

You could trip harder by eating more packages, but as you go beyond 4 packs the law of diminishing returns kicks in. Oh sure, you trip harder, but the undesirable side effects (nausea, diarrhea, extreme lassitude) become increasingly unbearable--ultimately compromising one's ability to enjoy the trip. The lassitude (for the vocabularily challenged, that means it makes you VERY TIRED) is not attributable to the presence of other alkaloids in the seeds, as some have suggested, but rather is a direct effect of the lysergic acid amides themselves. You see, in addition to its psychedelic properties, LSA is also a documented sedative, and in fact is scheduled (Schedule III) as a sedative and not as an hallucinogen. So no extraction procedure will alleviate the fatigue which accompanies, and to some extent, compromises the trip. 

Many report good results combining LSA with ephedrine, phenyl propanolamine, or any other legal and easily available stimulant you can think of. But be careful--you don't want to exacerbate the potential for nausea. Also keep in mind that ergot alkaloids such as LSA are vaso-constrictive to begin with and combining them with stimulants such as ephedrine, which are also vaso-constrictive, is not a good idea. It could send your blood pressure through the roof, increase the chances of leg cramping, and even make your hair fall out. So don't go crazy with the ma huang, eh?

It lasts about six hours, with a very steady peak that lasts for about three hours. The trip curve is very symmetrical: slow climb for about an hour and a half, nice steady peak for about two to three hours, then a slow come-down over about an hour and a half. Absolutely no hangover. You should feel nice and relaxed the next day.

Some closing notes on alkaloid content. You want to take Heavenly Blues; they have never let anyone down. Each seed weighs about .025 grams and is about .04% LSA. Two packages is a threshold dose and amounts to about 1 milligram of LSA (60 seeds/pack x 2 packs x .025 g/seed x [.04/100])= 1.2 mg LSA). Three packs gives a nice symptom-free taste of the LSA trip; four is ideal. Many would enjoy five packs symptom-free. Consume 6 to 10 at your stomach's peril. I once consumed 7 packs. It was a very intense trip--extremely enjoyable--but the nausea, et al. became truly unbearable. I recommend four packs--find your own level if you must. And LOOK OUT for those LEG CRAMPS if you overdo it. Keep in mind that overuse of LSA seeds could cause ergotism, a very serious condition. If you start to get leg cramps, it's time to take a LONG HIATUS from LSA.

In conclusion, let me just say that if you really have the extraction bug and feel you MUST extract, do the following: Get an electric coffee grinder--it's important. (They're cheap, about $20 in any Lechters so just get one.) Grind the seeds to a powder over a few minutes, pausing every few seconds so as not to generate too much heat amongst the seed. Why? If you just grind them to dust without taking pauses, the heat generated will destroy the sensitive LSA alkaloids. Fill a decent-sized jar perhaps a third of the way up with lemon or other citrus juice. Pour the seed powder into this and let it soak. The seeds will fluff up and absorb the liquid; keep adding water. Periodically shake and let the seeds settle, shake and let the seeds settle; add water as needed. After an hour, let the seeds settle a final time and pour off the top layer of liquid into a vessel for drinking. You can discard the seed mush. If you're going to use this method, you should use at least 10 packages of seeds as the extraction is very crude. Pour off as much as you can before the seed mush threatens to contaminate and then stop. Don't obsess; there will be plenty of LSA in whatever you pour off. Drink the 'pour off' and discard the seed mush and whatever residual liquid is with it. This will significantly reduce the side effects (nausea and diarrhea--only stimulants or a lower dose will alleviate the fatigue.)










The subject had heard the rumors about the psychoactive potential of DXM for years before, out of sheer boredom, experimentation with the material was undertaken. The subject was quite experienced in the realm of entheogenics, with the following experiences under his belt:

-LSD; including a 4 hit blotter acid trip
-Psilocybin; including a 5+ gram psilocybe mushroom trip
-DPT; The subject has binged on this mind bender many times
-XTC; multiple double drops and one triple drop trip
-Ketamine: Both via insufflation and I.M.; heroic doses

     So, the subject was certainly in a position to pass judgement on the relative worth of DXM. The first experiment involved the consumption of a 4 oz bottle of cough syrup containing only DXM as the active ingredient. Subject was careful to avoid medicines which combine DXM with such nasty additives as acetaminophen, pseudoeffedrine, guaifenesin etc.

     The red, sticky syrup was painfully consumed in approximately 10 minutes. Over the next two hours or so, the only noticeable effects were ever growing nausea, bloating and an annoying sense of fatique. Near the end of this period however, the subject entered a fast food restaurant so as to ammend themselves of the facilities. At this point, for a brief spell, the only 'psychoactive' aspect of the experience was realized, which consisted of a vague sense of confusion upon entering the restaurant. The sensation bore a vague, superficial resemblance to a low dose of Ketamine though it was in no way enjoyable or interesting. This feeling dissipated once the subject left the restaurant and within a half hour or so the subject was more or less at baseline.

     This experience left the subject with little interest in DXM or with any desire to explore the substance further. A couple of years later however, while perusing the net, the subject happenned across a series of articles on DXM experiences which reawakened his interest in the material; particularly the 'DXM FAQ' which outlines various dosage levels and plateaus of experience. The subject thought to himself '...maybe 4 oz's in a stomach presoaked with beer-

    (oh yes, the subject had drank about 6 beers
     before consuming the cough syrup)

isn't a fair trial...' and decided to give it another whirl. This time two 4 oz bottles were consumed, which should have provided a mid range experience according to most of the stuff circulating the net. The psychoactive effects that resulted, which kicked in about a half an hour after drinking it, were indeed more substantial than they had been with the previous experiment. This time around, an unmistakably dissociative buzz could be felt, vaguely comparable to Ketamine but much less interesting and not particularly enjoyable. No nausea was experienced this time around. 

The high might perhaps best be described as having given the subject a sense that 'well, OK, there is something going on here, but its not particularly interesting and I can see no compelling reason to explore it further.' Upon lying down to sleep, the experience came as close as it ever was to achieving some redeeming recreative value. There subject found lying with eyes closed particularly relaxing, and rather enjoyed the slight dissociateive chaos that rambled on behind his closed eyes. All in all however, it just was not a very interesting experience. It wasn't physically or mentally trying or in any way uncomfortable; it simply did not provide the subject with any desire to explore the substance further; nor were there any indications that 'higher plateaus' might be particularly rewarding. The effects of this 'mid range' experience might easily have been anticipated from the effects of the first 'threshold level' experiment. 

     In conclusion, I suspect that those with limited experience with true psychedelics and dissociatives might find DXM a nice, easily obtained legal high, but I can't imagine anyone with access to anything better ever seeking it out. It can be best described as a marginally  dissociative sedative. All in all, I think beer is more interesting than DXM.







Before I start, I realize that mixing substances like this can be dangerous, but I am a very frequent mind-flyer, and have done all the research possible for each of the substances BEFORE I tried them. Also, I realize slang changes over distance.  when I talk about cones, I'm talking about marijuana. 

It was my best friend's birthday, and what better way to celebrate his 18th than by going to the casino?? There were 4 of us, me, R, B and W who were participating in the 'experiment' and a couple of others who were just along for the ride (and a bit of a smoke, too). Me and W had to go for a BIGTIME trek to go pickup the supplies for the night.  This included 1/4oz of pot, a bunch of pills and 1/2 g of crack cocaine.  This was the first time any of us had tried crack.  We had a little bit of pot to smoke on the way back to make the long return trip more enjoyable.

Then me and W met up with R and B and went to our local smoking-hangout, where we proceeded to have our pills and a smoke.  For the sake of caution, we all decided to only dump half a pill each (for now) and have a little smoke to pump ourselves up for the main event.  We got a bit stoned, and in my confusion, I dropped my remaining 2 pills on the ground somewhere!! Well that pissed me off no end, and I wasn't sure if I was gonna have any fun, but we trudged on anyway, not really noticing any effect from the pills.  

We found ourselves at this little kiddy park with a cool spinning thing right at the base of a very big, impressive.  W divided the crack up into equal portions for us all (it came as a very hard rock of white powder).  It crumbled up to a little bit each, and we proceeded to place it on top of ready-packed (with pot) cones and smoked ourselves stupid.

W went first, and put a little bit of powder on top to try it.  After a little while he said it was 'unbelievable'  so I scooped up my entire portion for the night and smoked it in one go.  About 3 minutes later I scrabbled for my Walkman and put on my favorite track, which started to peak in its crescendo as I did.  I stood there for about 20mins with my eyes shut, swaying slightly, as I felt the music was a physical force, buffering me from side to side. Then my peak (which was by now as physical as the music was) flew up above my head and sat there for the tiniest fraction of a second, which then seemed to stretch out to eternity as I looked at my friends through the eyes of my peak.  My actual eyes were shut this whole time, but to this day I can still picture exactly what my friends looked like as I stood there, lost in a microsecond.

Then, when I realized I was tensing up in preparation for something, I relaxed.

BOOOOOM!!!!
It came flying down from above, and speared through my head, right to the tips of my toes.  PURE PLEASURE, MENTAL AND PHYSICAL.
I almost fell over with the rush that followed, and my closed eyes were now witness to a roller coaster ride that no one else will ever know about simply because it took off right from the point where words lose their meaning.  I have had more intense experiences than this before, but none that took me so completely by surprise.  It was as if it was waiting for me to relax before it began its beautiful onslaught of giddy pleasure.

After we had all had our experiences, we walked (a little unsteadily by now, since we were still smoking endless cones of pot) to the casino.  We thought it would be fun, but it sucked big time, coz we kept getting lost looking for each other, and a way out.  There were thousands and thousands of poker machines, and they just started driving everyone CrAZy with their DAMN ANNOYING NOISE!! We eventually found a way out, and met up with some more friends at the pub just up the main road from the casino. But everything seemed so insignificant after that beautiful, endless rush.

I don't know if I will ever try crack again, but I'm very glad that I tried it for my best friend's 18th, and I definitely don't recommend that anyone take a substance as seriously dangerous as cocaine without taking every possible precaution. Myself and all my friends have cell phones, and at the slightest hint of trouble, were ready to call for help.

Regarding comedowns:  We all smoked such a ridiculous amount of pot, that we were high for a coupla days, and probably came down in our sleep.









Twenty nine year old teaching professional decides to try MDMA. No previous psychoactive experience other than dope (a very long time ago and nauseating) probably going through a pre-thirty crisis thing. Hopefully this information will not prejudice my case.

The first trip:
At The Fridge in Brixton on a Friday night. Given four unknown white pills by the lovely N. I had been drinking earlier and had actually been violently ill in a pub toilet (I am not a heavy drinker). My nausea may have been due to the fear I was also experiencing. The idea of taking this substance was enormously exciting and scary (a factor which I still feel several trips on and is more acute when I am alone). By the time we got to the club I felt sober but in a poor way. I hadn't eaten properly that night and was worried about what effect this would have on me. I was also acutely aware of all the information I have to give to children about how this stuff would kill me stone dead. What was I more afraid of? Boredom or death? 

In the club I dosed myself with half a pill and armed myself with water and gum which I had been assured I would need. As a group of friends we danced for about twenty minutes. Fairly suddenly I was siezed with the desire to leave the group. As I moved away I became aware of a sudden shift in visual perception. It seemed to be a combination of two things. On the one hand I was suddenly able to look intensly at the faces of other people, a thing that we all tend to shy away from as it is usually a hostile act, on the other I was convinced that I could see much clearer (I am usually shortsighted) and marvelled at my new found sight.

I instincitvely moved away from the dancefloor and managed to find a nice cool fire escape to sit down in. This is probably a very bad thing to do but I seemed to be working at a very primative level. Curl up in a ball in the corner. Once I was sitting I vomited explosively. The interesting thing about this is that compared with earlier, alcohol induced sickness, this was a pleasent sensation. As I heaved, in one continuous motion, I felt physically healthy and content.

Once I had been ill I realized that I was experiencing certain effects of the drug. My skin was picking up on any hint of cooling air movement making it very pleasent and my sense of smell and taste had dissappeared. A security gaurd shouted to me to tell me that I shouldn't have been sitting there (head in hands feeling content) and I was pleasently suprised to find that I was able, with little difficulty, to both answer him, in a friendly fashion, and get up.

Back in the club I found that I was experiencing psychedelic reactions to colours and patterns. A white and black patterned T-shirt glowed insensly. The white appeared to be purple but this may have been reflected U.V. light which had an unusually bewitching effect on me.

From then on the night took on a certain set routine. I was attracted to patterns and shapes and was unable to contain my delight at them. Flourescent body paint was particularly alluring. I lost all interest in the music and it faded away from me. I found that I greeted the world openly, with a smile and thoroughly enjoyed meeting anybody who smiled back. I was aware that people who didn't smile found my behaviour disturbing and avoided them in a guiltless and carefree way; I was aware of potential conflict but it did not intrude into my blissfully contented state.

When walking I was able to move easily but was often constrained by a sense that I couldn't move and so proceeded in a stately fashion (semi-stumbling) around the place. When talking I was often overcome by a sudden wave of deep emotional feeling just before I replied to flashed smiles. These followed my habitual enqiries after everybody's good health,
'You'walrwright?' Which come from a man who would usually use twenty words where one will do.

I dosed myself with MDMA twice more; taking two pills in total.

Conversations were short and friendly. People offered me hugs which felt beautiful and satisfying in a way that no human contact has ever felt before. Interestingly, and despite all the hype, I still felt libidinous and would seek out the attention of women but I was both non-threatening and non-predatory. This, coupled with my new free and easy nature took all the awkwardness out of being with women and I was entirely happy, as were they to talk easily, hug, massage each other and kiss delicately. A very close and safe feeling suffused the place. 

The desire to wander is strong and worrying. My friends finally found me and were pleased to see that I was fine. I soon lost them again. I felt no tiredness until six in the morning when we left the place. I was still euphoric but the visual stimulation had gone.

The comedown was very gentle really. I felt tired next morning and my jaw muscles ached but there were no horrible hangover feelings and no speed comedown fluiness. I felt empty and slow and I realized that I hadn't eaten in a long time.

Subsequant experiances, alone and in groups, with mitsubishi turbos (a brown/pink colour) have lead to these revisions.

1: The visual stimulation with the unnamed white pills was strong but mitsubishis produced no such effect. They were euphoric but either their composition was different or my response had changed.

2: Ecstasy is a fun drug when you are living in the straight world and allows you to talk to people without fear and without playing status games. This relaxation of normal behavioural codes has the effect of making you attractive, both romantically and platonically) as you become a much more receptive human being and you appear to be non-threatening.

3: Ectasy is at it's best when you take it in an environment where others are also using. They are much more open to you. Beware tourists. At the Scala in London I found myself amongst many other users, and lovely people they were too, but a drunken few abused my trusting state (I didn't care too much) and I am aware how this could lead to trouble.

4: I didnt try dancing on my first trip but did later. Any fast limb movement enhances the euphoric feeling.

5: Sex and ectasy do mix. I have found that it prolongs sensual and so gentle sexual pleasure. However it can lead to worrying side effects. The combination of E and sex is so good that you over-do it. You care little for safe sex and you care little for your own well being. Burns, muscle strain and heat rash can be one of the results. After talking to others I realize that I am unusual in that I not only feel libidinous on E but am able to maintain erection. It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good.   

6: E enhances your empathic response and you seek to help those in distress readily with little fear.

I hope that these notes will be of use.







I stole the stuff from a cornfield, where it grew wild on one of our Geophysics excursions. There was a lot of it, and it was ripe, all cracking open like bean-pods.

I just took as much as I could put in my pockets without the others becoming curious. For about 6 months, it was just sitting in my cupboard. I probably got a good few grams (about 250 ml. of seeds).

At the end of last year, after my last exam, I felt like trying something new, so there was the Datura, and I had nothing planed for at least a week, and I live on my own, so unless I died, I would not have any problems.

I decided to do it all scientific, with reports every 1/2h, for in case I died, or woke up senile or something, I would not lose the data.

I dropped the whole pips (seeds) with water about 3:00 in the afternoon, and sat around waiting for it to have some effect. This was making me really nervous, so I played with my weights for a while to calm me down. After an hour I still had no noticeable effect other than the nerves which I had.

After one 1.5h, I started getting very sleepy, but not drugged-like sleepy, only normal sleepy. I assumed this would be due to the bit of weights I was doing, and my bad shape, so I went to lie down.

After about 4.5h I woke up, and felt really sick. I felt really weak, so I assumed I must have got sick, and the Datura had no effect. (I was expecting a Rush-like High) When I went to the bathroom, I felt really Off-balance. I got back in bed, and decided to sleep it off. Already all my nice scientificness has gone to crap!

I imagined myself covered with small red rash-spots, but my eyes could not focus to see if this was actually so.

I slept very confused, and don't remember much, only that it was confusing. The next morning I woke up, and still felt very sick, so I didn't get out of bed. Continuously through the day, I hallucinated that I got up and did something (eg. made coffee), and then found out that I did no such thing.
I had more than one experience of someone disappearing while I had a conversation with them. I had no success telling the difference between imagination and the truth at the time. In retrospect, I think when I imagined something I did not feel as sick. My eyes could not focus at all to read, or see clearly, and I still had to crawl to the bathroom if I wanted to avoid falling over, at about 3:00 that afternoon. It cleared quite suddenly that evening from about 5:00. I could not see any residue of the rash I imagined when my eyes could finally focus.

In retrospect, one might be able to get away with a lot smaller dose (maybe only 1.5tsp.), if one crushes it fine, which should maybe give a shorter trip, which could be more enjoyable.

I honestly don't recommend this the day before one is expected to do anything, no matter how little one takes, but I will do it again without getting panic attacks;)







Did you ever want to wake up from reality?  Sure, it sounds great...something out of the Matrix right?  Well let me tell you right now that you wont be happy with what you wake up from, and that acid is not just some fun drug to give you a light show...and it isnt the way to some greater truth either.  Last weekend I reached the peak of what acid tries to show us, and it wasnt at all what I wanted to see.  This is what happens when you lose your grip on reality.  Its long, but its very important.

A large portion of my life was determined to come closer to the truth of our existence, and to find the meaning in it all.  Despite what some of my friends now think, my life was basically led sober.  I didnt smoke pot until high school, and it was very infrequent, cigarettes only started when I was 16, and I didnt drop acid until September of 1999...first semester at college.  I will try to relay last nights experience to you as best I can, it is up to you what you believe and what you dont...Im just telling you what happened, and whats true to me.

To start with the basics, you have to understand some of my own mindset in order to understand how acid affected that mindset.  When I was in second grade I started getting nightmares...and I stopped sleeping.  After a while, the nightmares went away and were replaced with vibrant, realistic dreams--although the insomnia was, and is, still a problem.  The dreams were so real that at times I was sure that they were more of a psychic connection to something--dreams foretelling events.  I began meditating, researched different religious views, taught myself lucid dreaming, and a portion of my life was spent just searching for some great truth; some answer to our existence.

I was introduced to acid by someone who I thought had answers, in all actuality, he had just burnt himself out so badly that he was perpetually tripping; he neglected to mention that part.  In the beginning, my trips were wonderful.  The first person I tripped with led me on an intellectual journey, which was just what I was looking for.  I soon began to love acid, I believed it was helping lead me to some sort of enlightenment.  Above all, my mind was so intact during tripping, that I honestly didnt believe that I could have a bad trip.  Thats one beautiful thing about acid, how you can control it so well, just takes a strong mind...a strong mind that I thought I had.  

With an interval of tripping at least once every two weeks, my time in meditation became much more realistic, and much 'deeper.'  In fact, the last time I meditated before my last trip (which happened to be in class), I actually saw visions and was brought to such a state that my teacher's voice became obsolete.  This, coupled with a new set of intense dreams that woke me up in tears, left me with a frightened, yet curious feeling.  I knew that many religions believe that a series of intense dreams means that a change is coming, I didnt expect this.



I took three black pyramids with my friends Blair and Chris.  I had taken pyramids before, but never that many...two normally fried me out pretty good.  I also gave blood the day before.  Everything was all right until we were on the roof.  On the roof the world began to be completely unrealistic...but it was somehow soothing, so I didnt really think about it.  Before I knew it everything around me had become a dream world (note, I was off the roof by then).  Blair and Chris werent Blair and Chris in real life, but dreams; images of my mind that didnt exist.  I dont know exactly when the changeover occurred, but once I was there that strong mind that Ive always had retreated way behind my eyes...and I watched myself perma-frying on acid.  I knew there was something wrong, but I couldnt quite get it across.  I mentioned dying, I mentioned not coming back from the trip, but how were my two companions to comprehend my actual meaning when they were tripping just the same as any ordinary person, on LSD.  During the dream, some other consciousness inside me took over.  I cant decide whether it was created by the acid, or brought out by the acid...most likely the latter. 



While in afterglow, Ive been going through the pictures in my mind...trying to piece together exactly what I was doing.  I just remember everything being so foggy, just like a dream...and I felt like I was just floating around in a world created by my mind.  Blair and Chris were completely freaked out, I thought it was a game...Blair decided he had to drive me home, it didnt even cross my mind that he was tripping and it was dangerous.  I was gone, I was in lala land...and thats just fucked up.



They dropped me off in my dorm room, and left me to whatever was going on inside my head.  When they left, I started noticing how real my room was.  It had never looked that real in a dream before.  I pulled my covers over my head to sleep, and then it started to sink in that something was seriously wrong.  I jumped out of bed and looked around, and I saw the room from a mind that was perfectly sober.  I relayed the night through my mind, and I reminded myself that I had taken acid.  However, acid had never done anything like that to me before; Id always been in such control.  Then what I had to figure out was how my mind seemed as if I had just woken from a dream, as if I hadnt taken acid at all.  



I turned on my TV and as I watched the faces swirling in rainbow colors, I suddenly realized that my body was still tripping, hard.  I had woken from whatever cocoon I was in, mentally, but my body was still there.  Thats when it all hit me.  I suddenly realized that somehow I let go of reality, and that now that I had control of my mind I had to struggle to keep it.  Being in an empty dorm room made it difficult. I could hear noises of people turning on and off showers upstairs.  I heard people talking in the hall...I even thought I heard my phone ringing, but there was no one there.  I was without any contact to real living people, and I was in a small, brightly-lit dorm room, completely fucked out of my mind.



The first thing I felt when I 'woke up' was completely outside of myself.  I was always such an introverted person; Im content with being alone.  I know that to other people I have many 'nafs', as the Hindus say...or masks, for us Westerners.  However, to myself, I felt comfort inside of my own mind, and I knew myself very well.  When I broke out of the dream-world, those masks left me.  That comfort zone, left me.  And I was very, very alone.



My first hypothesis was that I had snapped out of my other body and that that body was completely perma-fried somewhere back in reality.  From there I wondered if I had snapped into another dimension and was forced to now walk around an empty world that looked like the old one.  I was even convinced for a while that I had died, it was the only thing that really made sense.



I had hypothesized that the world is full of new and old souls (Ive always felt I was an old soul, even before I heard the term).  I thought that since I could wake up from the dream-state of reality, that it was like any other dream state.  Normal dreams are created by the one consciousness of the dreamer.  So to wake up from 'reality' made me believe that we were all connected to one consciousness, but until we all, collectively, realized it, we couldnt move on.  This is what kind killed the idea that I may have popped into another dimension without everyone else.

The next hypothesis was that since I popped out of my own consciousness that my life would just be a chore, since its no longer real to me.  I didnt know how I would be able to continue, and for a second actually contemplated suicide.  The only reason that I didnt, was that I remembered how much my life means to me.  Ive always thought it to be so wonderful to just be alive, and I knew that I was still young and had a lot ahead of me...so I just wanted to fight to stay lucid while my body tripped out.

The first thing I needed to do was to make contact with someone real, to force myself to believe that there was some sort of reality, even if not to me, to the other people living it.  So, I called a trusted friend of mine, whom I had taken on her first trip.  She was very patient with me as I told her of what I had experienced, and threw out ideas at her.  At that point there were some conclusions that were so real that I couldnt doubt them.  I concluded that there was no God, or higher power (due to how alone I felt).  I concluded that new souls are reincarnated until they become old souls and are ready to move on.  I concluded that when they moved on they would be new souls and have to learn again to fend for themselves (again due to how alone I felt).  I concluded that life indeed was a dream within a dream (thank you Poe), but that the knowledge of that didnt solve a thing.

Mandalin brought me back to the house where my tripping companions were (who hadnt gotten back, so I left a note).  She then brought me to the first person I tripped with, since he had mentioned snapping four times, he had a lot of explaining to do.

We debated a little bit, over what it all meant, but then I had to ask him, if I would fully recover.  He said that he sees a rainbow pattern all the time, but hes teaching himself not to see it, and he has trip willies and acid mouth randomly.  He also mentioned that every time hes really hungry, or tired, or stoned, he starts tripping.  

This brought my mind back to something I had read on a FAQ sheet about LSD.  It had said that flashback are caused due to the high amount of psychological stress to the brain, not from the acid staying in your brain or your spine all the time.  So I logically knew that the only reason for my body to continue to suffer ill-effects from acid was the fact that I was now fighting so hard to clear my head, that I had somehow twisted my brain to believing that the side-effects of tripping were real.  What I had to focus on is that the world around me is real--to me and the people in it--but the effects of tripping were a drug that would wear off as long as I didnt cling to them.  The hardest thing to get rid of was the pattern.  As soon as I 'woke up' I saw a very vibrant, moving, rainbow pattern that surrounded everything.  However, through intense focusing, I was able to rid myself of it...Im sure itll return at random.

In afterglow I fought a constant battle between two halves: the part of my mind that had it all figured out, and the part of my mind that was just a little girl who was in a little dream world.  On one hand, I know that I freaked the hell out of the people I tripped with, but I didnt know it at the time.  I know that I ruined two friendships, and possibly more than that.  I know that I did things while I was frying that I didnt mean to do, that werent real.  Whatever dream I was in, it wasnt coming from my own thoughts...it was coming from whatever small child lies inside of me.  However, I know that Blair and Chris will never truly believe that, and to them Ill just be a really fucked up girl who wigged out on them.  I dont have enough apologies for that.  

On the other hand, I had to deal with everything I had just seen, and try to put myself back together so that I wouldnt crack...and I was very, very close to cracking.  After having my reality ripped out from underneath me, I had to choose what to accept.  This is what Ive learned: acid is a drug that stimulates a dream world.  If you take too much, or let yourself go to much, the world will become a dream...in other words, it is possible to actually lose touch with reality; no matter how 'put-together' you think you are.  Now, whether that dream-world is actually a view of our reality in a new light, or just a trick of the brain, that I cant say, but I can say that to stay sane, you have to admit the possibility that you were just under the influence of a drug which showed you one view of what the 'truth' may be.  

Above all, I learned that I was asking the wrong questions.  What I was shown through acid, I had already hypothesized...but for some reason I thought I had to experience it before my time.  What I know is that even if we had the answers to what comes next, no matter how wonderful or horrible, we dont want to know, it doesnt matter now and our brains do not have the capacity to rationalize it.  What we have, is a life, a reality.  Whether its real or false, its real to us, and thats what we need to keep in mind.  Instead of asking for answers from another realm, just enjoy the one youre in, and try to better it.  

If you think that Im being ignorant by trying to push away what could be real knowledge, then fine, go for it...it will be the worst experience of your life if you actually experience it--and I know you still wont believe that, I didnt, but at least let me now say, 'I told you so.'  Live the dream; theres nothing wrong with dreaming.








I usually smoke weed on the regular to help calm me down before i goto sleep.  As the other report stated, i was out of weed, and in need of something to get me buzzing before i went to bed.  I remembered my mom had aquired a bottle of tylenol 3's for a condition she was having with her foot, and had said when she took them, all they did was make her drowsy and dizzy. I also remembered that a while back, my friend had busted his collar bone and had to take pills with codeine in them, and he said they made him hallucinate.  

With no other means of attaining a buzz, i went to her bathroom and took 3 of the tablets to my room, along with a spoon and a full cup of water (the glass was about 6-7 inches tall filled about 1cm from the top.)  I took the spoon and mashed the pills into a fine powder (hoping it would hurry the effects along) and dumped it all into the water and drank it (i had just eaten dinner about 30 - 45 minutes before).  It wasnt the best tasting thing i'd ever had, but i was able to gulp it down without gagging.  Within about 10-15 minutes, i started feeling relaxed and comfortable sitting watching TV.  in the next 10 minutes i started getting dizzy, like when you're drunk (not pissy drunk, just drunk).  The total effect i felt was like when you smoke weed (cotton mouth, euphoria, relaxation) but i didnt have the slightest hint of paranoia... I'd never tried codeine before this and from my experience, a good lower dosage is VERY enjoyable and relaxing, and if i run out of weed again, ill be lookin for tylenol 3's again :)







I was married to a woman who suffered from a bipolar depressive disorder that had been misdiagnosed as dysthymia (a unipolar disorder). All traditional treatments were very unsuccessful. The most useless being the traditional garden variety antidepressants. Counseling by various health care professionals did little good either. The best way I can describe her condition while taking SSRIs like Paxil, Zoloft or even worse the Tricyclics like Elavil or Pamelor was that they turned her into 'The Stepford Wife From Hell'. Her emotions were unstable, her daily routine robotic and her sex drive nonexistent. 

I had been reading about the use of GHB in Europe and decided to order the Alcover brand from a place in Cham, Switzerland. After giving her the recommended dose, she became a mellow more empathetic, loving person, admitting to me for the first time in our 12 year marriage that she did have a problem that the doctors weren't doing anything for. I began to further pursue the avenue of European medicine as at that point in our marriage, I felt that we had nothing to lose. I read Bruce Eisner's book about Ecstasy and discovered that the drug MDMA had been used in experiments with depression and marriage counseling in Switzerland. I contacted Dr. Franz Vollenweider and had a brief conversation with him, where he seemed sympathetic, but told me there was nothing he could do without going through a doctor here in the US and the Swiss Consulate. I tried for several weeks to do this through the Consulate in Atlanta but by the time I got a reply our marriage had deteriorated to a point where nothing could be done. 

I am not part of the drug subculture. I don't use recreational drugs and I am very careful about medications I am prescribed. I don't drink alcohol. Yet what possible harm could it have done to have undergone therapy with any substance that may have saved a marriage and helped a person's suffering? Today my estranged wife, after leaving me to raise our two daughters, lives in another state and is known to be using cocaine, alcohol and crystal meth. Nice going FDA and DEA, what do you suggest now? Your sanctioned medications and professional counseling didn't do squat.









Cocaine truly is one of the most deceiving drugs I have ever come in contact with, it gives you a feeling of being great or even greatness. It is a very egotistical drug that makes most people I know arrogant assholes, myself included on a number of occasions.

After taking cocaine on and off for the last 4 months or so I truly believe it is a nasty substance, not in its natural plant form but rock or powdered form. The other night I went out with my friend and we bought a gram of coke for about 70 US dollars. We went to this bar and after getting our drinks we quickly escaped to the bathroom and cut up a fat line each then went back to our seats feeling that we were tricking the rest of the world. The drip was nasty, as usual, this time a little more so. My teeth went pretty much completely numb and I was off. I was feeling nervous and could not concentrate on anything for long periods of time, so a time later we went for another line and then another. There were some minor visual distortions, the lights had a definite brighter glow to them and some minor color enhancement. My palms were sweating so much that I was constantly wiping them back and forth on my jeans when I was not biting my nails or smoking cigarettes one after the other. 

I was not really very social at all and was not having much conversation with my friend at all, except when we hinted at escaping to the bathroom for another line. We would tell each other 'it's good, heh,' and all the other bullshit that I vomit out in whilst high on cocaine. I was not comfortable anywhere I was and not comfortable with myself. I felt nothing for no one or myself and all I wanted was another line when the gram was finished. The subject of getting another one was brought up at 7:0o AM in the morning. Thankfully we did not and went home.

I think coke is a fake drug that gives me a nothingness feeling and it is also bloody expensive. Never again will I fall in to the same repeating film of coke and coke nights out on the town.







A lot of strange things happened during this trip, to write it all down would be too much to read, so here it is in concentrated form.

Shroom are very hard to get where I live but we had been fortunate enough to get some, pretty expensive but what the hell.

My friend Zeke, his girlfriend Janet and I decided to devour our Cyanescens shrooms one Saturday afternoon. The weather was pretty bad but we where all so set so we decided to go ahead with our plans. About 3:30 we mixed the shrooms with some yogurt. I mixed my entire gram and Zeke and Janet had about 0.6 each. This was to be my first 'real' trip. We then went to a nature reservation that was just behind Janet's house. The reservation consists of about three big old abandoned quarries and the trippiest forest I've ever seen.

We had been walking for about 20 minutes when Zeke told us that he was feeling kind of funny. I didn't feel a thing and I was thinking that maybe I blew all my cash on bad shrooms. But about 45 minutes after eating them I was beginning to feel a slight buzz. There was a tingling feeling in my legs and stomach. I could imagine the psilocybin being absorbed and traveling through my bloodstream and eventually reaching my brain. By this time we had reached the forest and the first quarry. I suddenly began laughing myself stupid for no reason what so ever. The others must have thought I was getting mad or something. But I didn?t care cuz I was in a bliss.

I could suddenly see the ground slightly breathing and I was beginning to get seasick. We decided to move on to the next quarry. When we arrived the trip had become more intense, the ground was breathing very clearly by this time, and the rocks I was walking on turned into lizards heads. At this time I developed a theory on the meaning of life, but unfortunately I can't remember what it was (damn). The others had climbed up on a cliff and were calling for me. I had a problem getting to them because I didn't want to step on the lizards. Once I had gotten up on the cliff I sat down on the highest point and put on my CD-walkman. I was listening to HAB, (very trippy ambient music). When I listened to this music the ground I was looking down on started moving, different parts were moving for different notes in the music. I felt like a conductor and the ground was my orchestra and at the end of the song I actually heard applause. 

The next thing I remembered was that the ground instead of breathing started acting like water and was waving and twirling all over (pretty nice). The water was beginning to climb the rocks towards me, and of course I didn't want to get wet so I moved. We walked a bit further into the woods until we got to a big flat rock. We lay down on it and Janet connected another pair of headphones to my CD player. The rock was the highest point in the forest so when we lay down all you saw was the sky. It was a very cloudy day and the wind must have reached up to 30m/s. So needless to say the clouds where moving quite fast. Laying there watching the clouds they soon turned in to millions of fractals and symbols of old Greek gods  were floating by. Then I saw a bright image in the middle of my field of vision. This something or someone was playing the music I heard and the showing me the pictures I saw it was all special, just for me. I figured only god could show such divine beauty. I was laying down on the rock for about 45 minutes and during that time the sky had changed into all kinds of different colors blue, yellow, pink and purple and all kinds of shapes flew by. When I closed my eyes it was as bright as day and I saw all sorts of colors and patterns, but it was not very pleasant so I opened my eyes again admiring the show god put on for me.

I would have stayed on the rock longer but it was getting cold and I had to start moving. The trip was not as intense anymore a few strange pattern's or so but all I really felt was a complete clarity in thought. We walked to the biggest quarry and just sat there admiring the view of the beach and the waves that came crashing into the rocks. The afterglow was great. All three of us felt great and we went around with big smiles on our faces for hours. I knew then that this had been a life altering experience that I would cherish for the rest of my life.











Whoa..... that's how I shall preface this.  Just last week was the first time I had even heard of this stuff.  The person who gave me the seeds told me the story of the soldiers at Jamestown, and I thought 'wow, I have to try this crap!' Now, I am no novice drug user, I've pretty much tried EVERYTHING, but I don't think I was prepared for the 'stinkweed trip.'  OK
    
At this point I was very disappointed, so I went to bed. Well, evidently it takes longer to kick in than I expected, because when I got up to go to the bathroom about two hours later, my motor functions did NOT exist at all, I fell at least two dozen times, and ran into EVERY piece of furniture in existence in my apartment.  I broke at least one toe, cracked two ribs and bruised my tailbone, let alone the scrapes and bruises on my forearms, knees and buttocks. I also was talking gibberish, according to my mother, with whom I live, and Whom I scared shitless during this event.  I walked into her bedroom at 5:30 am and began rummaging around, when she woke and asked what I was doing I replied 'relax....' and then let loose a ten minute stream of gibberish, which I felt made perfect sense.  I also had in depth conversations with myself, although I cannot remember what the hell about.  I imagine I was still pretty fucked up for almost two days, I was unable to read small print as well until this afternoon (two days later) and I have finally stopped seeing weird movement in my peripheral vision.  
   
Aside from the injuries I sustained, I think I would try it again, in a smaller dose, and preferably WITH someone else, and most likely out doors, where there is no furniture or doorways to navigate. If you're considering trying this stuff, be wary, take small doses.







Success!
After smoking plain dried leaves 4 different times with effects similar to a marijuana buzz, I had success with some 5x extract in my darkened bedroom.  The first success, while listening to some foresty music, I became aware of small entities, possibly children, playing in the woods.  Very frolicky and happy.  

The second time, which just concluded a couple minutes ago, was much different.  After about 3 bong loads of the extract, I just sat staring at the bong until it and the carpet and walls all became a similar, rectangular pattern.  Then I heard a voice (I interpreted it as the plant itself), literally heard a real voice from my right side whisper 'Hey you.' I responded (in my head) 'Yes?' This next part blew my mind.  It said 'Mine', and a hand came out from underneath me and grabbed towards some leaves that had fallen around the base of the bong.  It then slowly pulled away.  

At that point, I really didn't know what to say or ask her (it), so I just said 'I love you.' for some reason. A few seconds later,  she eplied 'Hate you.'(!)  Well, that sucks! :)  I asked her why she felt that way, or what I needed to do to change myself to make myself better, so her essence might like, hopefully even love me. She said 'Try.' (I have a big problem where I know in my head what's right and good and what I should do, but have problems doing it in everyday life. Trying is exactly what I need to do right now).  

Anyway, after those couple minutes, the feeling tapered off, and trying to remember everything in it reminded me of remembering dreams; very fresh in your mind at first, then trouble with it later.  I didn't feel suprised or threatened at all, again, kind of dreamlike.  So, just wanted to contribute.  I have a feeling I'll be visiting Salvia more when I start putting more effort into things I need to do in real life, to make myself be and feel better.  Peace -








well i only tried this once and verified my disliking to downers once more, we were over at my friends place one night about three weeks ago, it was realativly quiet and we were watching a video, i ate five of the tabs one after another and waited for the effects which were first noticed about 30 minutes after ingestion, i felt a warm tingling in my hands and feet and in the middle of my chest quite nice but no big deal my pupils started to get really really small pindot small, also i started to feel a flushing in my skin and my body and then my whole bieng started to itch and itch badly like sweat getting in a cut this itch slowly started to get intense and was very uncomfortable mostly around the head and face, i went to the bathroom and my pupils were tiny.

This itch continued for about 20 minutes and then passed leaving me feeling warm and content this lasted about 4 hrs i then crashed out, my pupils were tiny the whole next day and some of the night.

it really was not worth the nasty side effects i got from it and for that content feeling i could have easily got off smoking three joints.







one day i was walking down the street on the way to buy doses when I ran into an old friend. As we talked I noticed that he was acting very weird. He asked me if i would please get high with him and I figured I'd share my nugs.

We went into the forest and the kid could berely walk which made me wonder. He told me he had 'k' and that it was a cat tranqualizer. I was scared to do it because it was injectable liquid right from the vet. I ended up shooting waaay too much into my shoulder and it instantly felt like
a bad nitrous trip with robotic vibrations. 

Everything was bad and when i tried to talk i sounded like Alvin and the chipmunks. I got higher and higher until I was convinced that I was dead and I couldn't even remember doing drugs. I was really scared and i floated in and out of outer space and I also had flashbacks of a bad trip at a phish show.  20 minuites after being out of body/dead?; I tried to talk and i could actually see the words hitting him in the face and it sounded like I was retarded to me but he understood.

I've tried to have good trips on this but it's too strong and I get sick too.






This was my first experience with a DMT source I read of in TIHKAL by Shulgin. At 7:00 p.m. I began smoking, with a small amount of grass, ground and pulverized root bark from Desmanthus Illinoiensis. I was expecting the 'instant rush'; this did not occur.  After fifteen minutes of continued smoking, I began to notice that the pot high was an order of magnitude stronger, which I attribute to the DMT. Set was internal exploration, setting was with a friend in a quiet, semi-dark room. He was smoking as well. I noticed at 0:20 that my chest and back muscles were spasming, and thought of the 'rottweilers that jump in and out of your chest', per T. McKenna.  I mentioned this to my friend, and noticed that my voice seemed to be coming out of a machine (my body), with which I wasn't strongly associated with at the moment.  It sounded deeper and more resonant.  It felt good to talk to my friend, and this deepened over another ten minutes (with occasional continued tokes) into a profoundly 'heart opened' experience, which I would put on a par with my best MDMA trips. I practice Kriya Yoga, part of which lengthens the spine. 

As I bowed (sitting crosslegged on the floor), I felt my spine open, and when I sat up, looked at my friend and felt that I was truly able to see him as God.  To do this I had, while bowed down, to see the deepest cruelties that humans are capable of (rape and murder). A kind, deep voice said this was a part of the human condition that a deeply realized being is willing to see. Being willing to view this with detachment let me appreciate the depth of love I had for all people, and I was able to express this to my friend. This intensity lasted for perhaps ten minutes, and the comedown was very gradual.  I am writing this almost 20 hours later; no residual effects at all, but I have felt a pleasant centeredness and afterglow.







I consumed the mushrooms with a few Ruffles to eliminate the taste of the fungi.  I tripped fairly well for a few hours and was on my way down from the peak of my trip. I have smoked salvia many times before this and decided I was ready to attempt it in combination with mushies.  So, on my way down already, I packed myself a bong hit of the five times salvia extract (probably about .15 grams).  I turned off the lights and music and lit a candle.  I puled the entire bowls worth of salvia in one bong hit and held it in my lungs as long as was possible.  

I laid down on my bed and closed my eyes... shit... It was one of the most incredible experiences I have ever had.  I could feel (and see) in my mind the salvia and the mushrooms fighting for superiority of my mind.  It was like two titans clashing with my mind as their coliseum.  I have experimnted with mixing drugs on many occasions and enjoy seeing which drugs will prevail.  It seemed to me before this point that psilocybin wa!
s a dominant drug...taking over alcohol and marijuana with ease..but the salvia kicked its ass.  After the initial mind/body waves that took me over, a flood of colors and sensory explosions bombarded me.  When the salvia seemed to be winding down, I sat up and opened my eyes.  Holy shit.  I was peaking again.  I tripped harder than i had during the peak of the mushrooms for another solid hour.  Mind blowing.  This, my friends, is how the salvia was meant to be smoked....








My name is Kayla, I'm 17 years old and now sober.  I had this experience on acid; it was fucking insane. I HATE acid.  I know a lot of people that would disagree with me but this is my opinion: Acid is a very dangerous drug and you really do have to be prepared for a trip.  Anything and everything will affect it, even shit from when you were 6 years old.  I've had a really messed up life so the first time I tripped was crazy. Here's my story.....

One day I was just kickin it with my friends and they invited me to a rave.  It was my first rave so I felt a little awkward there but then I saw a few friends and felt a little more comfortable. It was about 11:30pm when my friend found some acid and we decided we both wanted to trip.  We each bought 5 hits of blotter acid and took them all at once.  At about 12:15, I started feeling weird, not hallucinating, but I just wasn't comfortable and I started noticing things change, like my fingers were discolored and it looked disgusting.  My arms and wrists looked like they were bleeding everywhere and I turned to a friend and asked them if I was bleeding everywhere and they all just sat and laughed at me and told me I was, and that scared the hell out of me.  That's when I realized how fucked up I was. I started to peak an hour later, and when someone talked to me, I couldn't understand them, it sounded like they were rats and they were just squealing so I'd run away...and the bass at the party was making me think like a psycho, like how much I just wanted to kill someone or what if I die....weird thoughts kept going through my head. I didn't know what to do with myself, I started puking, I couldn't understand anyone, my arms and legs felt like they were about to fall off, I thought I was bleeding everywhere, and the worst part is, none of my friends cared.  They just laughed at me like I was their entertainment and pretending all of this.  

That's all I remember from there on. I don't remember shit.  All I know is I woke up at my friend's and I was completely out of it for 3 days. I was practically delusional. I wouldn't respond if anyone said my name and I couldn't walk.  Some of the other odd things people said I did:  I tried to run through a brick wall in front of the paramedics, and I was sweating and crying for about 2 hours.  As for my friend, she was hospitalized and put into rehab for months.  The doctors said her heartbeat was going up and down so rapidly she could have died any second....I guess I was just lucky, I took the exact same acid, off the same sheet, the same amount, and we weigh exactly the same.

That's my story....you might laugh, but believe me, if that was you, it wouldn't be so funny......anyway, if you're gonna do acid, do it in a safe place you're familiar with and with people that care and have done it before.  If it's your first time, know what to expect and don't take more than two hits your first time!!







Up until a year or so ago I along with most of my friends thought of cocaine as an evil force which could send you spiraling into addiction and worse. But then I began to think how I had approached cannabis. For years I had steered clear of dope but once I had tried it I found I could control it with ease and use it to my own advantage. So why should coke not be the same.

One afternoon I was at a friend's house when he produced a bag of cocaine and offered me a line. I was instinctively wary of taking it but then remembered how I had reasoned it out to myself and decided to join in. I did a fairly large line in each nostril and smeared what was left all over my gums. For 5 or 10 minutes there was nothing, but then it kicked in. The numbness spread all over the roof of my mouth and soon I was away. Suddenly I was talking like there was no tomorrow and the feeling of confidence and arrogance was overwhelming. But when I came down there was no longing for more. Had some been at hand I would have taken it but there was no desire to walk the streets in search of a dealer.

There then came a long gap of about 10 months with no coke. The next opportunity was after a night out clubbing. I had taken some MDMA (A Mitsubishi to be precise) but had not come up at all. Then after the club, we agreed to go to a friend's room to get a gram of coke. We got there and got stuck in, snorting up a good big line each. We set off for home but were already flying. We stopped off in our college library to do some lines of the tables, by now we were on the top of the world and being caught was not an issue. We were away, all talking at once and all believing that we were the fountains of world knowledge. Having started the night at about 10:30 PM we found ourselves still buzzing at 9 AM.

That night was a bit of a binge but I continue to use cocaine. A couple of lines during a night of joint smoking always helps make the night a really good one as coke can really bring out the effects of other drugs. I am pretty sure I am in no way addicted as I never really crave at all, but this could be the result of a strange ability my family seem to have to not become addicted to anything, cigarettes, alcohol, whatever. This seems to make cocaine an ideal, if not a tad expensive drug. I can see that it could cause problems but I think as with any drug, so long as you treat it with some sort of reverence then it should be fine.







I am a frequent cocaine user.  Usually every friday night and sometimes saturdays too.  I use minimum of a gram a week but maximum of two.  I have never had a bad experience on cocaine.  I spent two days snorting a line every half hour while walking the streets with a friend and drinking black coffee.  I have never felt so beautiful, smart, funny, and happy in my life.  I was chatting up everyone I met.  

The key to using cocaine is to become aware of what your body is telling you so that you know when you are ready for more or when to stop.  That way you maximize your cocaine experience and become the fun loving, confident person you are meant to be.  Don't forget that if you haven't used it before to take it slowly and be VERY careful.  If you respect the drug for what harm it can bring you and use it carefully you can have many years of happy, healthy cocaine abuse.  : )









I was at a rave with a few friends and we all decided to buy some felix blotter acid. I dropped both hits around 1:15am. I had a great body high. I had an amazing amount of energy and i couldn't sit still. At this point, i wasn't hallucinating yet. I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off. I couldn't stop dancing, i had to keep moving. The dj was spinnin' a creepy trance track that made me think psychotic. I was nobody's friend, not even my own, but i was still moving. I didn't want anyone to touch me. It seemed as though everyone was against me and nobody cared. I didn't understand the whole scene, questions like...Why do i do this to myself? Why do people enjoy LSD? Why would anyone like to not be able to tell the difference between a dream and reality?

That's when i stopped myself and tried to figure out who i was, why i'm here, what did i take and things like that...but i just didn't know. Right there everything hit me. The bad trip started to take over. I felt as though i couldn't control myself, but i just kept moving. After thinking like that for about 45 minutes and dancing, i sat down next to a huge brick wall. I lit up a cigarette and looked at the wall. The bricks were spelling words out, like Death, End, Over, and i closed my eyes, shook my head, looked at the wall again and there were 6 bears dancing in a cirle with sharp teeth just grinning at me, and then i realized how fucked up i was. I jumped up and ran over to a fence and grabbed onto it and just stood there. That fence seemed to bring me to reality, like when i was holding that fence, nothing could hurt me. It was like that fence was sobriety and reality - it was really there, it was the only thing that i knew was real. I looked around and everyone looked like crazy fools running around. It seemed like a riot. Through my eyes, it was total chaos, but it was really a bunch of people just enjoying themselves at a party. I was horrified when people would try to talk to me. Their skin would look disgusting, their voices would give me chills. Then the psychotic thoughts came back. I was thinking to myself, maybe all these people are in a cult and this is a gathering. Maybe they just advertised this gathering as a party to get people to come here and get all fucked up and then eat their brains or some shit. I would look around and everyone seemed to be watching me. I couldn't handle it, i had to leave. I stood up, lit a cigarette and started walking. I stared at the ground while i was walking. The grass looked like a bunch of pins waiting to prick me. It was a horrible night and i still don't remember everything or what happend after i stood up. I don't remember where i went or who with, but i guess that's something you should expect when you take a psychoactive drug like LSD. So, if you're gonna trip, know what you're in for and be careful.







My most memorable 'trip' is one that now occupies my every thought and action.  It has entirely changed my perceptions of existence, evolution, spirituality, conciousness.  It was an experience at home, there were three of us.  I took only one hit.  We set the atmosphere by lighting with blacklights and candles, and we listened to goa music (some call it psychedelic trance).  

I felt the acid creeping on, the giddyness, the happiness, the visuals, dancing and moving with the fluidity that acid provides.  As I was dancing in a room by myself, I was struck with a feeling that could only be described as divine.  I began to sense that inside me there were two selves.  Perhaps it is incorrect to separate the two, but in order to illustrate my point here, I will do so.

We have a face to the world, we have our personalities, our likes and our dislikes, our ambitions, and our fears.  We have our insecurities as well.  But this divine self in us knows not of insecurity.  It is a feeling almost equal to pride, only it is not egotistical, it is not arrogant, it's not a feeling of 'Look...I'm better than you'...it's a feeling of 'LOOK...I'm equal to you...and aren't we fabulous!!'...it is divine. :)  Each of us is divine, but our perceptions of ourselves become muddled in this world by fear, and prejudice, and society...blame it on whatever, we lose that connection to our spiritual/subconscious selves.

Once I had discovered this, I had new clarity, new purpose, new focus and understanding.  I realized that this being is my consciousness.  From there, I lay down, closing my eyes.  Exotic patterns circled through my mind, changing in color and shape with the music.  At first it was two dimensional, and then it became three dimensional, and I seemed to travel into the patterns, until I was inside the very 'fibres' of that pattern, and then it was a molecule, and then I was inside the atom, and then inside the sub-atomic particle....until I realized that I was no longer aware of my physical body.  I was like a mind, floating in space...hehe...rather, I was like eyes...exploring.

I could look out into the vastness and see only energy, see all worldly things, as the same energy.  It was in this vast nothingness (allness), where I realized that my conciousness could travel wherever it pleased.  That one could still be self-aware, without being physical.  That the physical world is only ONE state of being.  I realized that when the physical body dies, if we are in control of our own consciousness, we can still be aware, and exist in another state.  Therefore, there is no such thing as death.

I saw life as energy, all things are just energy in a different form.  What makes a human different from another form is that we have a consciousness, and we are self-aware.  I realized many things.  I believe that we choose our parents.  I believe that our spirits are constantly evolving.  All these things I don't just believe...but I know.  What is true for me, is not necessarily true to another.  There is a huge difference between believing, feeling, and knowing.  Before, I believed and felt the concepts of reincarnation, of different states of consciousness, of energies.  Now, at last, I have seen.

I floated back to the physical world, back to 'reality', only to go to bed shortly after.  I fell into lucid dreaming for the first time, which was fascinating.  I woke up feeling rested, yet knowing full well I had been self-aware the whole time, I had been 'awake' and exploring.  The lucid dreaming continued for two days afterwards.

There isn't much that can make me unhappy these days, as I am more in control of my own reality.  I look forward to my next 'trip', I look forward to expanding my understanding.  Such experiences must not only be recognized, but taken and applied to life.  I can only continue to evolve.







Started around midnight with a normal-for-me dose of mushroom tea.  After the peak of the mushrooms (about 2.5 hours or more into the trip), added 10 mg of foxy which I had never tried before.

At first, the speedy effects of it almost overwhelmed me.  I don't always react well to speedy drugs so was prepared for the side effects.  However, I seemed to not be having any of the interesting things I had heard about foxy but an unshakeable case of the twitches and body spasms.  At one point, the spasms were so irritating, I considered taking a dose of valium and sleeping it off.  I'm glad I didn't.

After about a half an hour of the twitches and spasms, I had a very intense wave of good body sluggishness like everything had slowed down.  My blood felt like it had slowed.  This feeling increased steadily and in waves for a good duration of the trip.  At many points, when I thought I was coming down, I would become completely incapacitated by another wave and sink back into the marshyness.  The whole experience felt very 'swampy' and pleasant.  Once the speedy effects had worn off, my body experienced a very good overall physical feeling, similar to that of MDMA but with much less tactile senses.  There were points when I could not feel my body parts or the person touching them.

My memory of the trip is scattered so some information is from my observer.  It became very difficult for me to move any body parts and I was thoroughly convinced that they didn't belong to me anyway.  My observer stated later that my motor coordination and verbal skills seemed very *off* but I was very comfortable quickly with these alterations.  I seemed to float in and out of consciousness at points but was under the impression that I had gone 'somewhere else' not just into a sleep-type state. 

More than once while looking around the room, the objects and my observer disappeared and I was somewhere else.  I knew inherently that they were there on the periphery but was not able to visualise them at all.  A couple of times, I came back from one of the losing consciousness episodes and told my observer that I had left my body.  I was pretty sure I had.  This happened more than one time as well.  It was a very comfortable and safe feeling, partially b/c I trusted my observer not to let anything bad happen.  And also b/c the leaving my body part was very interesting and pleasurable and had good body sensations associated with it. It was very freeing.

Occasionally, my mind would be so disconnected from anything going on that I would say a sentence and then realise how incomprehensible and silly it was and retract it.  There was a lovely one about waffle irons which was more tangential than I can even explain.

For most of the peak of the trip and also while coming down, I had great difficulty speaking.  At points, I couldn't talk at all and tried hand signals etc. to communicate and decided that it was just too much trouble.  There were definitely points where the only thing I could do was lie on the floor and give in.  Even with some strange visuals and places that I seem to have gone (a bench outside a jail cell with ppl coming to lock me up but my observer wouldn't let them), I felt very safe and comfortable the entire trip.  Even when some of the music touched an uncomfortable spot, my mind seemed to accept that it was all natural and a needed piece of the trip and I enjoyed it.  It seemed that it would have been hard to find a way to mess up the trip.  My overall mental state was very blissful and I remember laughing and smiling a lot.

My visual experience was similar to some I have had on acid and mushrooms but was much richer and fuller.  Things appeared from objects in the room and seemed to completely morph into things I had never seen before.  This is what usually led to the out-of-body experiences.  I don't know how long I was in these experiences.

At approximately 9 am, I was still tripping but coming down slowly.  I took 5 mg of valium and got some sleep then woke up and ate ravenously.  I was still fairly trippy in the head but was mostly able to function.

From the information I have been given about ketamine, I would say there were some definite similarities that I was not expecting and which I have been told are not usual reactions for foxy.  However, my experience was very very pleasant and most likely will be repeated to see if the effects are similar on subsequent trips.









I have tripped about 9 times total in my life, and have also combined LSD with ecstasy, marijuana, and amphetamines at various times. I have found that LSD can be a misleading and deceptive drug to some extent, and I believe that accurate reports relating to the clinical effects of LSD should be read by the possible user before dosing.

My first trip took place over a whole day. Me and 3 other close friends, two of which had taken LSD before, dropped our acid at about 9:00 in the morning and set off for a trip to the beach. I could not feel the acid kick in until about one and a half hours after we had dropped it. I went swimming while waiting for the acid to hit, and it was a fairly exhilarating experience. In retrospect, it was also incredibly dangerous.

That first trip left little side effects (so it appeared) and I did not feel changed or altered to a noticeable level.

After taking progressively larger doses of LSD (up to 2 T's) brain alteration became significant.

At a rave (dance party) I dropped 2 tabs of the strongest acid I have ever touched, and this completely changed my life. The LSD was obviously in control of both my body & my mind, and this was quite a disconcerting experience. I can remember talking to people I did not know, and being looked at with mystified looks because they could not understand my unraveled chain of thought. The loud techno seemed to work its way into my head, and took control of my soul.

I started dancing after the second tab of acid hit me, and I was actually quite scared by the realization that a man-made chemical could be so in control of my entire existence. I can still remember the rush as I melted and merged with the music, as I danced harder and harder in an attempt to work off the endless reserves of energy I seemed to possess. While I was dancing, a girl I did not know walked up to me and calmly stated, 'I believe you have lost this', and handed me a small piece of paper. On this piece of paper was printed, in capital letters 'THE PLOT'. This freaked me out so badly that I could feel my brain and inner consciousness balancing on the brink of insanity.

The next day the post acid depression was so acute it was close to an acutely tiring head pain, and I was physically sick from my experience. I did not take acid for close to twelve months after this trip, and have only tripped once since then. I am not going to take LSD any more simply because my body can no longer handle it without suffering horrible after effects.







I took about 3-4 hard and long tokes of Salvia divinorum one night at my girlfriend's and immediately I was catapulted into some strange room filled with people I did not like.  I was in the room with her - she was supposed to watch me, but unfortunately this idiot took me to some party downstairs as soon as I was done smoking.  

Anyway, I felt very wrong.  Incredible waves of strange feelings of alien anger overwhelmed me until I simply couldn't hold it back!  I was trying to tell one person whose face rippled like a pool of water in the wind that he better give me my money he owes me or I was going to do something about it.  He apparently did not understand what I was trying to say - my girlfriend (the bad sitter) told me that what came out was total gibberish!  Anyway, he recognized my general tone and wasn't happy and he basically told me to screw.  I did not hear this because the rippling in his face became more violent as he got angry and the rippling made a sound like some sort of deep-vibrating instrument, like a cello or oboe.  I interpreted his actions as hostile and people were gathering around.  It looked like I was on display by a bunch of entities or gods with rippling faces.  I felt small and my body sensation felt as if the mass or matter of my body was getting small.  Time distortion was horrific!  

This may have been one minute but seemed longer.  I turned to my girlfriend and tried to tell her to get me out of there but she did not understand.  She did not appear to be an entity like the rest who were still staring at and poking me to get my attention.  I turned back around and the music in the room began to get louder.  At this point the room seemed to get brighter as the music's loudness went up and I couldn't handle it.  I freaked.  I turned around to hold out my hand to my girlfriend hoping she'd understand me and take me back upstairs, but she was GONE!!!  Then I got pushed!  I fell down and slid under some table whose legs looked like an animal.  I thought I was somewhere else, like a jungle.  I wanted to get out from under this elephant's legs.  I got up and realized it was a table.  

I saw a huge cake on the table with a large knife next to it that shined as if beckoning me to end this harassment.  I turned to look at the crowd of entities.  There were only two or three there, the rest went away - possibly no longer interested in the ruin of this party I was not invited to.  The hostile entity came toward me quickly and his face turned from a ripple to a violent boil.  I backed up and hit the table and my hand had something in it. Before I realized it, I was on the floor again and all the entities were back again with faces of fire.  I was wet for some reason.  I tried to speak to get someone to get me home, but it did not work.  I got up and two entities held me against a wall.  None of the other entities were staring at me anymore, but they were staring at a lump on the floor.  The music was gone and room darkened.  Many entities left.  Two blue entities appeared and held me down and were speaking strangeness to me.  I nodded my head 'NO' several times.  They seemed to understand that I, did not!  

I started feeling the come down.  It was abrupt.  I went from incoherence to a deep, stoner-like high as I was being helped down a flight of stairs.  When the front door opened, I saw blue and red flashing lights and began to feel confused again, but then I thought I figured it out - that they called the cops on me and I was being arrested for disturbing peace or something.  

It was not until I was at the police station that I found out that I had almost killed someone.  The police seemed to generally gather that I had not realized or was even conscious of what I had done.  They told me that they searched the party for illegal substances, but found none and asked me what I had taken to put me in this state.  I told them that I simply drank one beer that was handed to me by a stranger and that within minutes lost all sense of reality.  I began to cry at the horror that had come about and began to wish it was my girlfriend who I had just stabbed.  I called am attorney and stuck to my story.  Luckily everything was worked out and understood.  My family helped me to cover damage and medical bills, but the victim admitted to the cops that we had money issues and that he did not take full caution or did not fully realize that I had been drugged against my will.  Everything ended okay and the money issue was restructured - I owing him money!

Chose you sitters wisely, folks and if you cheat on your girlfriend, make sure she doesn't find out in addition to NOT asking her to watch you during psychedelic episodes.  But first, do not start a relationship with someone who if things get bad will be more evil than you!






I first became interested in LSD when I accidently stumbled across an LSD article in the dentist's waiting room.  The article told briefly of the commonly experienced psychadelics of LSD.  I had never really given LSD a second thought in the past, but after cross-examining it I felt as if I was missing out on something.  I decided to start researching the drug and also contacted a few individuals that I knew had used LSD.  

I've always been a very careful person when in comes to foreign chemicals.  I would always research a drug thoroughly, seeking both users' and non-users' facts and opinions. After about 3 months of bi-daily research, I had decided I had read virtually every information-bearing LSD website I could find. Thus I decided I was informed enough to ensure safety and enjoyability in my experience.  I went about obtaining some LSD by contacting a friend that I knew had used it in the past, and we planned a trip.  My first LSD trip took place at his house, in which I ingested one sugar cube, and acheived somewhat of a trip.  I was extremely giddy, and the experience as a whole was extremely positive. Unfortunately, the more cosmic, psychadelic effects that I'd expected were absent.

The only hallucinations I experienced, besides the shadow of a branch that I saw as Medusa, were images I conciously manifested with my own imagination.  One of such images were a 'lizard man', a velociraptor with knee joints as humans, that was cloaked and squatting in the corner, flicking his tounge fiercly at me.  Once I manifested the image and it was in my vision, I felt an evil presence.  However, I quickly snapped out of this by reassuring myself that the drug had surely induced the vision. Even though I'd say that the hallucinations were enough to tell about, I didn't experience the complete alteration of time, space, matter, and thought that I hoped for.  I wondered if I didn't take enough LSD, and I presumed that perhaps I was more resistant to the drug than other people.  I decided on trying it again, this time from a different person and in a different form.   

I decided that the way I could acheive the trip I wanted was through more potent form of LSD.  Many people have told me their non-convincing experiences with paper-form LSD, and I decided I had to investigate for myself.  A few months after the first experience, I obtained 4 paper hits, and with my friend, took 2 each.  The effects were very familiar to the first trip.  Once again, I was giddy but no significant mild-alteration was present.  Just when I was ready to give up the quest for psychadelics my friend found another form.  He had met somebody, and he had obtained a few geltabs, thin squares of gelatin spotted with LSD.  I was given another hope.  We called another friend, and planned a trip.  It was to take place in some campgrounds we were to soon visit, a nice place with all the conveniences of the city (fresh water, heat, air condition) and all the wonders of nature.  It was surrounded by woods and a nice pond was nearby the house area.

When the time came, it was me and my two friends, D and F.  I chose not to use their names because I haven't informed them of my plans to document the trip.  We had 4 yellow geltabs, and decisively distributed them among us.  Since F had never done LSD before, he would take 1, and me and D would take 1 1/2 each, us having some LSD experience.  We decided to go inside and play cards while waiting for the wonders to come.  After about 30-45 minutes of cards, I began to feel the same effects as my first two trips.  I looked at the clock, thinking at least an hour had passed, but was wrong.  I was roughly 35 minutes into the trip, and already was lost in thought.  It was if every thought would start a chain reaction in my head, activating more and more thoughts to the point that I was pondering several very different topics at one time. About 1 hour into the trip, playing cards became extremely difficult, as I was being bombarded by abstract and fragmented thoughts and ideas.  With all that was going on in my head, the last thing I was thinking about were the cards in my hand.  Giving my hand to F, I decided to sit and try to calm my brainstorm restfully.  

I was only resting for about 10 seconds before I caught some movement in the corner of my eye.  I saw the ceiling moving, taking on a flowing form, as if it was silk being blown by the wind.  Being the first visuals I had ever experienced, I was awe-stricken.  I sat and watched the movement spread onto more surfaces, noticing that the movement was stronger whenever I looked. I could see movement in the corner of my eye, but only when I looked directly at something would it shift and dance. After staring at the floor for several minutes, I decided to return to my friends.  'D,' I said. 'Are you feeling anything?' He gave me a blank look and cracked a smile at me.  His pupils, almost completely dominating the blue of his eyes, were all I needed to see. 

It had only been a little over an hour, and we were all tripping.  We decided to take a walk outside, to see the newfound wonders of the surrounding area, despite the fact that it was around 10:00pm and very dark. We walked through a dimly lit path in the woods, and each tree we passed seemed characterized.  I felt as if I was walking among strangers, but an easy, relaxed feeling took over.  Despite the fact that I was walking into the dark woods, under the influence of a drug I had little grasp on, I didn't have an ounce of fear in me.  'Is it just me, or are these trees covered with a dark blue fog.' D said. I stopped and looked up at the treetops.  Among the almost pitch black treetops I saw beautiful patterns forming and changing, becoming more complex every second.  D was talking to me, but I didn't notice. I was awe-stricken.  

A tap on my shoulder got me out of the trance.  I turned around, and looked at D and F behind me.  It was extremely dark, and I tried to focus on their faces, but it was not their faces that I saw when I squinted at their extremely dimly lit heads.  As their faces came into view, they started taking on an evil, monster-like characteristic. I immediately thought back to reports I've previously read that described panic attacks upon seeing drug-induced and negative hallucinations. I told myself that it was impossible for them to be anything other than D and F, and despite what I saw I disregarded this and suggested we go back inside. We walked back inside, and upon arriving at the house I was overcome with another relaxing sensation.  I sat down on the couch, and was put into a  kind of a trance. 
As I sat and pondered the situation, one thought branched into a chain of thoughts, followed by another branch of thoughts, and was thrown into a series of mental visualizations that simply blew my mind. I had a similar experience after eating 225 Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds and smoking cannabis about 3 hours later, 2 after my stomach rejected the seeds.

'Lets go to the pond.' I suggested.  A quick walk through the woods would get us to our destination, a shining mirage of paradise in the moonlit night.  I visualized the pond. I saw the bright moon shining on the water, its sandy, beach-like shore (only on one side of the lake), and benches on the sand to relax on.  I smiled. 'Let's go.' We skipped over to D's care and extracted a few bowls of cannabis from his bag and headed blindly into the woods. We made our way through the woods, and upon doing this I noticed patterns on everything, and forming out of everything.  The leaves on the ground formed patterns, and the clouds in the sky formed patterns.  It was amazing.  I was busy staring at the pattern, and we got there quicker than I expected.  

I looked out at the lake, and sure enough, the moon lit up everything.  The reflection of the moon on the pond was shifting and moving. We walked over to a bench and sat down. D pulled out an 'irish' pipe and a bag of pot, and lit it accordingly. I took a couple of hits, and it wasn't until about 1 minute later that the peaking effects of the LSD returned in full effect.  I noticed the colors of the leaves on the ground melt together, the intense and rapid thought process returned. It took me by surprise, for part of the reason I wanted to smoke was that I suspected the LSD was wearing off.  I was mistaken however, because now I realize that they effects hadn't wore off at all, as if I was still on the trip's plateau.  I was only getting used to effects of the LSD... becoming accustommed to the moving surfaces and not thinking of it as abnormal.  I recognized how this could potentionally permanently damage my thinking process, and paid more attention to the psychadelia.

I stood there for a couple of minutes, trying to remember the sequence of events preceeding the present time.  It was then I remembered I had a few 'Sparklers' in my pocket.  Sparklers are fireworks... you light the end of the long metal stick and sparks spew out of it for about 1 minute.  I pulled a Sparkler out, and lit it.  It took a few seconds to light, but once lit immediately exploded into a rage of sparks intensified by my hallucinations.  As I moved it around my vision, tracers followed it in a very flowy motion, and the path of the sparkler in my vision was revealed until the sparkler went out.  When it went out, my heart was racing.  I was amazed.  I turned around and looked at D and F, who were also left silent by the beautiful display of colors.  I lit a few more, and we smoked another bowl before heading back inside.

The walk back was similar to the other treks through the dark woods. Everything I could see was a part of a beautiful pattern. D and F also saw patterns. Upon returning to the house, we all agreed that 4:00am was a reasonable time to go to sleep.  We went to bed, and though I'm still unsure whether they managed to go to sleep, I was in a complete state of insomnia.  I laid in bed for an hour or so before the effects of the pot took its toll on me and I passed out.

I hope this report shines some light on the LSD experience, as reports submitted before mine helped me to better understand something I had no knowledge of. I believe that knowledge and preparedness are essential when it comes to hallicunagenic experimentation.







I had been wanting to try HBW seeds for a long, long time and finally got the chance. I ordered 60 seeds for $20.00 over the internet.

Me and Dodd and Nam decided to try them out to see if they are as good as we've heard.  Nam, an experienced dropper tried one as he had homework and other things to do that required a sober head. We decided to scrape the hairy coat off the seeds with Dodd's penknife.

This took bloody ages, so in the end we peeled two and opted to crush the rest in a coffee grinder and add water to the pulp (this way the seed matter is soaked into the water and the coating sinks to the bottom).  We shook the water and left the mixture soaking for forty-five minutes. While we were waiting Nam started to come up on the one seed and recognised lsd feelings, this is acid he said. We returned and drank half of the mixture each and ate one of the seeds each.

We felt no nausea at all and the mixture did not tase bad at all. We decided to go for a drive (Nam drove) and Dodd said he could feel it coming on (it was his first trip) He started to feel worried as if he was going to jump out of a plane or something. I began to get a little bit excited but nothing more.  After about half an hour, the trip came on.

Colours became intense and the music started to surround me. When I looked at my hands they were changing before my eyes. It affected Dodd more than me. He was laughing and saying this is amazing. Throughout our drive we could not stop laughing and were having the happiest time of our lives. Dodd came very close to hallucinating, but it wasnt to be. Colours were really bright and space seemed different (this was most noticable in Blockbuster video.

By the time we got home (about 2 hours later) we went into Nams sitting room and I noticed the walls were breathing and  space became really distorted. We watched Pink Floyd's The Wall and I felt more emotion and pitty than I have in a long while. After this I went back to my room feeling depressed for about forty-five minutes.  But then I thought about all the good in the world and how Pink Floyd cared about veterans and the trampled people and began to feel very happy and content. I went back to Nams for awhile and although the lsd feelings had almost subsided I felt at total peace...very, very mellow almost like I had smoked a bit of hash.

I slept like a baby that night and the next day in the place of a hangover, I had eight hours of intense happiness and well-being. At the end of the day I had a very minor visual, I saw little pieces of light like fireflies descending down on me.

Overall a very happy and trippy experience, which I would definitely recommend. The water mixture idea is no good though, we missed a good quantity of seed matter and probably ended up having more like four or five seeds each. This volume was a lot of fun. Certainly more fun than being drunk but for hallucinations more are probably needed.

p.s We experienced no nausea and even had a bite to eat while tripping, the seeds did not taste disgusting and neither did the water mix, we also had very fresh harvest seeds.










I have not looked up to see the older man who is sitting in the row across from me at the greyhound station; nonetheless, his cane is tapping out a message coded especially for me. I am staring at the hands in my lap, mine. This is the second weekend that I have smoked opium, brown rock (a gift for which i am most grateful) presumably at one point extracted from Papaver somniferum. I had crushed and mixed it with tobbaco. The smell, taste, and buzz seemed correct. As I stared at my hands I became aware of how much time I spend in my life waiting. waiting for the bus, waiting to understand, waiting for things to make sense. waiting. How much my mind tries at times like these to organize its thoughts, even the things which can never be organized and must be accepted (as a storyteller leaves out the details which do not pertain). 

On the way home I am acutely in tune with my surroundings. someone has got 'bells for her' coming very softly out of their car stereo. This too is a sign from synchronicity, perfectly dovetailing into my current life enigma. I am thinking on that old coot William S Burroughs, Jim Carroll, Aleister Crowley, famous and infamous junkies and fiends. I think on tea, and china. social mechanisms. How perfect this opium seems to make sense of my antisocial sides, my geometrically precise version of solitude. unapologetically selfish but hoping to offer some [help/beauty/rawmaterial]. 

Perhaps the most germane effect, for me, and what made this solitude worthwhile, is the sensation that i can hear things above and beyond what i normally would register. for example, I played a song to my companion hoping to point out a certain string section. However, we never quite made it to that point because we noticed an amazing phenomenon. In the song, an extremely faint one string, vibrated mercilessly throughout. it felt as though i could now experience subsonic and ultrasonic vibrations. yum. The aftertaste of opium is delicious to me and i am certain of its usefulness. uncomfortably certain. I am now more aware than ever of who in my life has taught me things, and who has learned from me or not learned from me. Just when i need to see it most, I see that not only *can* i rise above all occasions, but that I must, whenever possible, do so. I am recommitted to my mortal existence, to the fact that the social structure of the world holds an ideal to which it wont admit, to which i do not fit, and to which i am compelled to find creative ways of skewing.

Overall, the opium receptors in my brain were engaged to varying degrees for 48 hours after smoking.  I hope in the future to experiment with a combination of opium and psychedelics.















i used to only do extasy with my boyfriend until i got invited to a rolling party. my best friend and i decided to go. we bought these tablets called ferrari. we both took one pill and started smoking some weed. after about an hour i started to feel the familiar rushing feeling. my stomach was turning and i felt that every time i moved i might get sick. there were candles everywhere and the heat was jacked up to 85 degrees. someone was dancing with glowsticks and there entire body dissapeared and all i could see was these incredible lights making wild patterns in the darkness. i glanced at my friend and she seemed to take on the body of a very fat person. she had double chins and filled up the entire recliner.

i decided that this drug was messing with my head and that i needed to concentrate on something but i was so trashed that i found it hard to do. i fell into an ehole which many people have never been in. i thought i had a ten minute conversation with this guy right next to me and when i asked him why he didnt answer me he said that i had not said anything to him at all. it felt like i had been in another body because i snapped back into reality and wondered where i had actually gone. then we took another pill.

i chilled and listened to music for a long time. then i looked up at my other friend and all of a sudden her face morphed into mine. it was very strange looking at my face on someone else's body and the other me started to talk even though i couldnt hear what i was saying. i kept closing my eyes and reopening them to see my friends real face but her face would not stop morphing. this was the coolest e i have had. i used to be able to morph peoples faces when i first started rolling but now its hard to even fall into an e hole because i have done it so much.











I'm an experienced psychedelic user, having taken LSD, mushrooms and MDMA many times over the last 14 years or so. Even after reading many trip reports, Salvia has struck me as remarkable in its near-absolute lack of similarity with any of these other drugs.  This report chronicles my first two substantive experiences with salvia, both of which were remarkable.

Just before we began our first session, we were greeted with a surprise visit from the friend who supplied our leaf days earlier.  He lives 15 hours away by car, and happened to pop by on his way home.  He knocked on the front door just as we were loading the pipe.  A remarkable synchronicity!

Music was playing in the room - a very ambient, slow sound-scape, electric and soothing.  The lights were dim, and the curtains drawn.  After the second hit off the full glass pipe, I began to feel I was losing motor control.  My limbs were heavy and a little tingly.  My vision seemed to be lengthening such that I could see incredible detail and color, but in a much smaller peripheral field than normal.  So, quickly, I took a third hit, and then sat back.  I exhaled, and closed my eyes.

Almost immediately, I felt as if I were being sucked down and backward through some kind of barrier or membrane, and that everything that got sucked back into this emptiness was turning hard, or to stone.  I felt as if I weren't breathing, and that the blood had frozen in my veins.  Immediately intimidated by this encompassing sensation of death (this is really the only way to describe what it felt like), I seemed to stop my passage by sheer force of will.  I felt as if my face, feet and hands were sticking out above/below/in front of the infinite membrane that bisected my body.

The membrane itself was totally two-dimensional and visually lucid.  The best way I can describe it is to compare it to a vast field of creamy white taffy, with chocolate swirl patterns stretching into the distance.  The swirls made compartments that looked like the Star Trek logo, almost, or even like the numbers you pull out of the machine at the deli line (in shape, not in color or texture).  They moved with the music.

I don't know how long I was stuck in between this odd reality and whatever was behind/under me, but I remember my friend saying something (what, I wasn't sure) and then felt myself snapping back into the room.  A matrix of clear visuals similar to LSD or mushrooms remained for several minutes, but I felt as if I had either 'jumped out' or been 'spit back' by Salvia.

In the next half-hour of reflection, I decided that what I felt wasn't my body hardening, but disappearing, as my consciousness attempted to pass backward through the membrane.  This feeling was unspeakably REAL, as real as consensus reality, and proof positive for me about the illusory nature of our bodies and perceptions.  Admittedly, my stunted passage was a horrifying feeling, not unlike getting something caught in your throat - the thing that's stuck there (in this case, my consciousness) either needs to go in or out.  But I sensed that had I held that third hit longer, I would have simply propelled all the way through before my fear got me stuck.  So I ordered more and waited.

A week later, my friend visited again.  At first, he had considerable trouble getting through with the potency of leaf that I had bought.  My own first try (three big bong hits) was a bust; it landed me back in that stuck-in-cement feel that I had the first time, but with enough consciousness left to know that I wasn't going to 'break through.'  But I felt considerably more comfortable with the pressing sensation now, and a half-hour later, I was ready to go again.

I smoked four lungs full this time, and as I leaned back into the couch, the familiar pressure set in.  This time, however, it gripped me from the top of my head and peeled me open like a banana, splitting me into two.  My body became the membrane, which began as a plain, shiny white this time, and split into two directions.  These 'half-me's' - which were not me at all - wound around my visual field until they re-merged in front of me, like lava flows melting into one another.  Embedded in the membrane were what appeared to be countless different realities, vivid and timeless.  I noticed in particular that one was a street corner, but wasn't thinking fast enough to read the sign.

It was then that I felt like I was enveloped in some distinctly feminine presence, almost as if a womb were weaving itself around me, or that I was becoming a womb inside a mother.  I asked, without asking, what these realities were, and the answer (which was not spoken) came back: they were realities that I could choose to return to from this place.  At this time, the room I was in (including my friend) passed through this membrane, and I suppose I chose it.  I said, 'okay,' as if I were ordering off a menu, and then I felt my body return.  I opened my eyes, looked at my friend, and laughed out loud.  Minutes later, I was up and about.  Baseline.

Fascinating!  Please know that the words above are the best way I can find to describe the experience, but cannot even remotely encompass it.  There is no context for this plant, and I sense that it will take many visits with her to understand what she is trying to show me.  One final note (okay, two): sitters are important, and please don't venture into the realm of Salvia unless you have given it careful consideration.  If LSD or psilocybin provide a gradual, staged loss of ego, salvia is a rapid ego-ectomy with no anesthesia.  It seems in some way to model the cycle of death and rebirth, and I can see the death phase giving some people real trouble.









Mental and physical state entering experience : 

Mentally I was in a familiar environment with people I have known for years, people I am familiar with and one person that I had never met before.  This included ground control and one whiskey bottle bearing drunk.  Not having had anything overly stressful happen to me lately my mind was clear and ready for a positive experience.

Physically I was up on 4 hours of sleep.  My consumption of solids consisted of a hand full of chips, some excellent bean dip and sesame tofu from my favorite chinese restaurant about five hours prior to dos time.  My consumption of liquids consisted of 3 beers and two shots of whiskey.

Times are likely to be off by up to 4 hours.

11:30 PM - AMT was ingested by A 75mg, B35mg? and C 35mg (myself.) and D (8-10 ounces of whiskey and a couple of beers.)  I and not all but several of the others also had 100mg of 5-htp at the same time.

11:45 PM - I feel definite effects even thought he capsule hasnt even had time to dissolve let alone the 30-60 minutes for the come up period.  After some contemplation I attribute this to a psycho somatic effect.

12:00 AM - The second wave shows up and proceeds to consume AMT, E 45mg?, F 35mg, G 35mg. 

1:00 AM - Effects are a definite, vomiting is occurring for A, E and G, most everyone has cramps to varying degrees.  Sudden movement had been blamed for the vomiting.

2:00 AM	- Everyone reports a general state of happiness except for B who has fallen asleep.  We are left with no choice but to cuddle, I am feeling emphatic towards everyone and unlike MDMA I am not feeling emphatic towards inanimate objects or people who have wronged me in the past.

Comments made between 2 and 6 am (peak/plateau) -  
Where is my depth perception?
Whos arm is this?
Eep, eep, oooggth.
Is that happy writhing or grumpy writhing?
I wish I had a trampoline.
Are you Sancho?
I lost my frame of reference.

6:00 AM	- Somebody mentions the time, looks of shock sprout up in the room.  B wakes up and shortly there after goes home.  The rest of us are amazed and suspect that he will have a difficult time getting through his planned morning activity of going to church with his girlfriends family.  E by far had the most intense experience.  Since my stomach cramps were mild earlier I am paying for it now with slightly more intense cramps, pacing seems to help.

7:00 AM	- I mistakenly think that sleep is possible and the trip is over.  Sleep results in brief 30 second dreams followed by waking in a panic.  The increase in light makes me aware that my eyes will not stay put, attempts at focusing take up to 10 seconds and sometimes fail all together., life is however still blissful.

10:00 AM - D wakes up and asks me to drive him to work.  I agree since the world seems normal from my prone position, 15 minutes later in an upright position is becomes blatantly obvious that not only am I unable to drive but that I am unable to stand with out holding onto something solid.  Breakfast is discussed at length, nobody is ready yet.  E starts to drink Gin and Tonics, claims they help.  

12:00 PM - F also has to go and brave the world, the bus is decided upon as no one is able to drive still.  I become sad as I imagine my self riding the bus for 2 hours, I wish that F didnt have to go.  The sadness was replaced by a happy euphoria within minutes.

2:00 PM	- It is decided that the rest of the day needs to be written off as a loss.  Movies are put in the VCR and food is cautiously eaten.  In an attempt to get some peace I start drinking beer, E was right, it did help.

8:00 PM	- 21 hours after ingesting AMT my eyes stop bouncing around as much and thoughts of sleep creep in.

10:30 PM - Sleep occurs.

7:00 AM	- After almost exactly eight hours of sleep I and everyone else awakens.  The predominate topic of conversation is how impressive it is that we dont all feel like hell.  Showers are taken breakfast is eaten and we part ways.  Driving home I sneezed as the sun catches my eye.  A shudder of pleasure follows and I am reminded that all is still not right in my world.

Points of interest 

Alcohol and AMT mixed with no noticeable side effects.

With the exception of the four hours between 2 and 6 AM I felt as if I could have dealt with any situation that did not involve heavy machinery.

Everyone wished to take more next time.  I assume this means they were satisfied with this time and felt that more would be safe.

To reiterate, after only four hours of sleep the night before and a 20 plus hour trip I feel great after a mere 8 hours of sleep.








It all started when I was 14. My friend came over to my house one day, tweeking, and she had some with her, I had never done it before, but I really wanted to try it. She carved out a tiny little line for me, and I snorted it quickly. I can't quite describe the feeling, all I can say is, no other drug that I've ever done has kicked in that quickly. It's a euphoric rush that went through my entire body, making me feel exhilarated, happy, and hyper too, of course. 

To be honest I can't remember much of that whole day, or night, but I know we just kept doing more, and before I knew it, I was hooked. For a year and a half of my life I was completely and utterly under its spell, I was going through half an 8 ball a day. And then one day, my then current boyfriend (whom I had been dating for about a year and who was also a tweeker) turned to crack, then heroin, and slowly turned into a completely different person. The same thing happened with all my friends, the drugs slowly devoured the people I once knew, and turned them into mean, uncaring drug addicts, and it all started with meth (at least in my circle of friends) So, I decided to quit. 

Honestly, it wasn't that hard, well...for the first month or two. I still wanted it, but I left the people who still did it, and found new people who didn't. It's been almost 2 years now, but last week I fucked up, and I did some. I only did about a dime, but that was enough. I don't regret that I did it, because I think of what I went through, and to go through that when you're only 14-15 is hard enough, but when you're turning 18 soon, and you're starting your own life, you don't want that shit holding you back. It really isn't worth it at all, I can honestly say, 'no, I don't want to do it', but deep down inside, I really do. And that feeling will probably always be there. I will try my damndest never to do it again, because it is a horrible, EXTREMELY addictive drug for me. 

I would say, if you ever have the chance to do it, DON'T! It will fuck you up for the rest of you life. I'm at a point right now, where I'm almost positive I will never do it again, but I will always want to, and that's almost as bad.








*All doses taken 1/2 hour prior to sleep on empty stomach

Night 1: 500mg Valerian root, 50mg B-6, 6mg melatonin

Nice dreams, situations in dreams were quick to change as I couldn't stay focused in one dream or another for very long.

Night 2: 500mg Valerian root, 1g B-6, 6mg melatonin 

The increased B-6 helped to realize I was in a dream, but outside influences (namely my baby sister) kept me up and awake most the night.

Night 3: 2g Valerian root, 1.5g B-6, 6mg melatonin

By far the best experience yet, I actually dreamed I was up and walking around my house getting ready for the day when I got into my car I heard a ringing noise, looked to my left and then realized I was starring at bed side table with my alarm clock ringing loudly. The dream was very real and accurate. The best part was realizing everything I had just seen was just a dream and not reality. I heard my foot steps, I saw and heard the tv on, I heard outside noises, everything was in it's place like normal, and it seemed too real until I woke up and then jumped for joy realizing I was just dreaming.

I will continue large amounts of all Valerian root, B-6, and melatonin to see what happens. I want to get to that reality point in my dream again and see what I can control or manipulate. I also want to see how many of my senses I can affect at once. I will keep you all informed.







I would like to start off by saying this was a planned spritual event and turned out to be so.  I have never heard of anyone taking syrian rue with amanitas and this was an experitment.  I fasted all day aside from a cup of yogurt, as to decrease nausea.  Interesting enough, I had no nausea and did not vomit.  The most physically distressing part is on your stomach when you are passing from your subconsciousness into your supraconsiousness.  As long as you keep yourself reassured that you are alright, you should be fine. :)

T:  8 grams of dried amanitas were eaten with a couple cups of water.

T+1 hour:  I definitely started noticed an enhacement of my auditory sensitivty.  While riding in a car with my friend I could hear every sound outside of the car.  The sould of every car's engine seemed amplified.

T+2 hours:  2 grams of powdered syrian rue was ingested with a chaser of gatorade, followed by 2 grams 20 minutes later along with a friend. My friend had not taken the amanitas.

T+2:45:  about 6 grams of dried P. cubensis mushrooms were divided equally between my friend and I (3 grams each).

T+3:15:  I definitely started to feel the effects of the mushrooms now.  Colors are enhanced and the sizes of objects start to seem a little distorted.  At this point I have a mild case of diarrhea and gas, I assume from the amanitas.  It wasn't bad at all, it felt kind of good, even though I'm starting to trip a little.

T+3:30:  I start to feel extremely relaxed with an great feeling of euphoria coming on.  Visuals are getting stronger and when I close my eyes I can see in 3D, like I'm staring into a darkness but it looks like a black hallway with doors on the walls of the hallway.

T+?:  This is when it starts to get really strange and I mean REALLY strange.  Time seems to be slowing down.  Visuals are getting extremely weird.  The texture of wood seems really interesting.  I can see into the wood, like through it, and the visuals aren't the same as with just psilocybin.  I start to feel an extreme heaviness in my whole body like I'm tired but not physically tired.  At this point I lay down on the bed and feel really relaxed.  I lay there for a minute or too with my eyes closed have closed eye visuals, and whoa, I jump up, it felt like I was falling into the bed, but I fell too heavy to get up and just lay down and go with it.  It starts to get more and more intense.  The falling feeling accelerates and I notice myself starting to have REM's which accompany an intense visuals and energy flows.  The strangest thing was when I was having the REM's my friend laying down next to me was like 'whooa', and it was like he could feel what was happening to me.  

I don't know how long I was in this state but I seemed like 45 min.  While I was in this state I was aware of everything that was going on in the room, but it seemed like in a far off place.  At the end I felt an extreme emptiness in my stomach and thought I had forgoten to eat or drink water or something and I asked my friend if I was dying and he said 'no'.  In the back of my mind I knew I wasn't and I remembered reading that this was going to happen.  The next thing I knew I just got up and started walking around the room.

T+4:  As soon as I got up I was like 'whoooa'.  I felt GREAT, as if I had been asleep for a thousand years and just woke up. I felt godly. I was extremely calm.  My thought-speed was greatly accelerated.  The visuals were extremely intense and very earth bound, not like colors patterns associated with traditional psychedelics but with distortions in size and color of objects.  Time goes by very slowly and there is an enormous amount of internal dialogue.  The experience wasn't focused on the hallucinations though.  It was focused on my interactions with others.  Many people don't believe me but I had the most intense psychic experiences I have ever had at this point.  There was an intense energy and psychic exchange between me and my friend.  I could read his mind, and he could tell me what I was feeling and thinking. It was very strange.  My friend and I pretty much sat around for 3 hours just talking about things and talking about our experience between each other.  There are a couple strange things I noticed about the amanitas.  They pretty much diminished my emotions.  I could think regardless of emotions and I could judge the difference between everything good and evil.  I wanted anyone to ask me questions and I felt I could answer them all.  There was also a separation of the body and the mind, like they were in two different places, and it felt like I was not in my body at the time.  The rest of the experience seemed pretty much was the same after I came out of my subconscious state.

T+8:30:  I'm pretty much down now and it is a little difficult to sleep.  I'm still having interesting revalations about life and religion.

This was one of the most intense experiences I've ever had.  There was a definite religious and telepathic note to the whole experience.  The visuals were incredibly awesome and nothing like LSD.  I would definitly try this again in the forest when camping.  For those of you wanting to try this, I strongly urge you to have a sitter with you and you can communicate much better with people of mushrooms.  It seems the P. cubensis and syrian rue opens up your psychic conections and the amanitas just blows them to a whole other level.  Also getting along with drunk people will be very difficult in this combination.








Well, after doing some carefull research on Methcathione, I decided that I would go ahead and try to make some.  The recipe's all over the 'net right now and let me tell ya, it works.  

The most annoying part of the whole experience was trying to find the potassium permanganate.  The faq decribed where I might find it and I went to most of those places a few times.  Finally I found it.  If anyone out there is having the same problem I did here's a bit of advice: the bottles are usually pretty damn big and placed in boxes for selling.  So it may not even look like a chem at first glance.  Just read the labels carefully.

My friend T and I set out to make about three grams.  Not too much or anything, just enought to see if the recipe worked.  After evaporating off most of the water, we had what looked like about two g's.

All night long we smoked this stuff.  Very fun.  The taste is very close to crank smoke.  I actually think it is identical.  The effects are a little different.

I'm not a speed freak (anymore), I grew somewhat out of it after high school.  I still remember though, what good meth feels like.  Methcathinone comes nowhere close.  The euphoria is just not there compared to meth.  There was a strong sense of energy with some light headedness.  I felt pretty damn good all night.  We polished off what we had in like three hours.  The stuff got me spinnin' pretty hard, but it kept me fiendin' for more all night.  I didn't feel a strong comedown, it's just that the plateau began to wear off and I would miss it so bad.  But, all in all a good experience.







I just got an ounce of dried Leonotis leonurus.

Some net research has told me that the active principle is leonurine, the same alkaloid that is mildly psychoactive in the similar Leonurus sibiricus (marihuanilla). Addictive on the order of nicotine with regular usage, according to Gottleib. Alleged to produce a MJ-type euphoria.  [Also, the plant contains marrubiin, a bitter principle good at increasing secretion flows (such as bile), and has expectorant properties. For headache, cough, etc, prepare dried foliage as a tea infusion. I'm unsure of the dosage.]

Smoking this plant produced MJ-like effects, only milder, and a somewhat larger amount must be taken. I just had about two joints worth, and got a buzz roughly equivalent to smoking half a bowl of average commercial grass (or sharing a pinner with a pal). Beware of the small thorns!!

I have read that the foliage is used by the Zulu as a medicinal tea, and that only the flowers + flowering tops of the plant are smoked. I'm going to try alcohol extraction to make 'wild dagga hash oil' and see how that works. 

--later--

Tried smoking a joint or so of the plant with no effect. I read that the African specimens are stronger, so I'll definitely make the extraction.

--later--

Well, I made a 5x extract of the plant matter using pharmacy-grade 91% isopropyl. If I wasn't enthralled with the smoke's flavor before, it sure revolts me now. Extremely 'planty' in flavor; made me gag and nearly vomit. Let's put this down for now.

--later--

Tastes just as bad as previously. This is not even worthwhile as a drug for a desperation high. Ever since that first attempt, I have gotten no effects from this plant. I'll chalk the first experience up to the placebo effect.

Final opinion: Don't waste your time with this 'drug'.







This is a description of the experience I had on February 15th, 2000 while using, from my research, what would be considered a moderate to low dose of Adderall (d-amphetamine).  As a quick summation (there is a better summation at the end of this document, so be sure to read the entire account of events), I'd say Adderall is like X, but ~1/4 the power, and with many different effects and, most specifically, different benefits.  Also, keep in mind higher doses will probably produce significantly stronger reactions; this is my assumption based on my experiences as a recreational drug (tonight) and as a medicinal agent for my very light case of ADD (2 years with very few breaks).

At 5:00pm I took 30mg,.  For scale, when I was on the drug for medicinal purposes I took 25mg, but it was spread out over a 6 to 8 hour period.  (15 mg at 8 am, 10mg more whenever I needed it, like doing homework at night, so really the biggest kick I got was on 15mg).  Also note after speaking with friends and acquaintances who have exceptionally more drastic cases of ADD than myself, 30mg at one sitting is a physician prescribed dosage.  If you have never taken Adderall before, the doses that I took this evening will more than suffice to give you a very good overview of what the drug will do to you.

It kicked in around 15-20 minutes after five.  However, I knew what to expect as far as the initial effects, so you might not notice it for ~25-30 min or so.  The first thing I felt was that I suddenly realized I was thinking very deeply about everything, and I don't mean in specifically a philosophical way.  I was just thinking practically about how things work, different ways in which I could utilize them, whatever was naturally entering my mind.  Entirely normal thoughts, but I took them to the next level, giving them more attention than I normally would.  It could definitely go philosophical if you wanted it to though, and what you come up with would most definitely be worth listening to later (if you were inclined to record the experience).  I kept my train of thought and expounded on it in very applicable and reasonable ways.  My thought train only derailed if something more interesting entered my mind, but it would have had to have been much more interesting than what I was currently pondering, not simply different.  Even then, it was a natural decision to change my focus; the new element did not take over on its own.

I thought long and hard about what was in my head, but was still aware, even more than normally, of my surroundings.  Once I had taken a thought as far as I liked, I instantly (and most importantly in my opinion, naturally) switched to something else that I would have normally moved on to if I had been sober.  In other words my thought process was more complex, but followed the same logic and patterns I always have.

This effect, of heightened awareness and deep thought, lasted throughout the 'learning' (like rolling, or tripping) experience as I have dubbed it (assuming there isn't already a name for it).  Friends and I also now refer to Adderall as 'A+' for various obvious reasons.  I am unaware of any other pseudonyms, and this is simply my personal nomenclature.

About 45 minutes into the learning process (I am in class now, waiting for 6:00pm when it starts), I got a warm, tight feeling in my chest.  Kind of like the immense goodness you might have felt on acid or X, but the feeling is more of a tightness than a warmth or burning, and is much less intense, yet still very noticeable and very enjoyable.  Now all my emotions were good in nature.  Not necessarily happy, but good.  There was no way I could have felt bad (unless something truly tragic occurred), but I could easily comprehend bad things and could have changed my demeanor if I saw fit.  I'd like to add that I am a firm believer that any drug experience will be made better if you are in comfortable surroundings and a good, clear mindset.  That was the only preparation I considered before swallowing the pills, but then again many of the other factors, personal reactions to the drug etcetera, had already been ironed out since I took it medicinally for 2 years.  You should find out if you have any risk factors to take into consideration.

More specifically about the feeling in the chest, when I started thinking about something and got the least bit excited about it, the feeling in my chest would come over me in a whoosh and I felt I was ready to take on the world, as I continued to delve into thought. I just kept having good ideas (and although I was still learning when I wrote this, I can honestly say the ideas are quality, no weird deranged thoughts that only make sense while I'm using. I could use these ideas later.  Speaking of later, I had no problem remembering events that transpired or what I thought about.)

Along the lines of this 'goodness', I could control all the effects the drug had on me, at least at this dosage, although I'd speculate at any dosage that isn't extraordinarily excessive this would remain accurate.  I could let it lead me off somewhere, but I had more than enough power to stop it if I needed to (ex: I was in class, so who knows what I might be confronted with), and since I was unusually aware of my surroundings it's not like I would have snapped back into reality and thought, 'oh shit, the teacher is talking to me, straighten up dude, straighten up!!'  I knew what was happening in real time, so the switch from deep thought to 'Yes professor I understand the before mentioned postulate' was seamless, and I actually would have understood the postulate.

By the way, this entire description is in more or less chronological order, although most all of the effects are still felt until you start coming down.  

It's was then 6:00pm and class was starting.  I had been learning for 1 hour.  I felt as though the recreational effects were starting to wear off a bit, as I wasn't feeling the 'goodness' but still felt very alert and was thinking in double time.  (If my mind was a processor, it would have been pegged at 100%, but I would have been experiencing no system lag :-))  I started to examine my situation to see exactly what the drug was still doing to me, if anything (for posterity i.e. this document).  I realized that my inhibitions were lowered, but in a much different way than most people are used to.  While I didn't want just start talking to people around me, or blurt out / do things I normally wouldn't have, if the chance arouse to speak with someone, I didn't hesitate.  Also, while I was not trying to be everyone's best friend (like some experience on X), I felt enthralled in conversations I was having.  The best way I could describe it, is that I felt very good, almost ecstatic (but a controlled ecstatic) that someone was listening to what I had to say, and I thought to myself how great it was that this other person was interested enough to share their ideas with me.  (If you're wondering, I was talking to the guy next to me a bit before class began, at like 5:55pm).

I looked at my watch well into class and realized it was 6:30.  I thought, 'Damn', as it felt like I had only been there for around 15-20 minutes.  I'd say time was sped up by around 30%, but I didn't really notice unless I looked at my watch.  It was weird, while I was listening to the Prof. it seemed like time was passing normally, but that somehow I was getting more out of it, as if I was managing my time better, being more productive.  Once I realized it was ~15 minutes later than I thought, I simply went back to taking notes and the time issue slipped out of my mind.

I found I was taking very detailed notes, but not just writing down everything the Prof. said.  I was able to extrapolate the most important things, while taking everything he said in.  This could also be applied to conversations and events that were unfolding around me.  I seemed to be able to notice what it was that was important about them, but without disregarding the less important aspects.

So it was getting close to 7:15, and my brain was still working double time (but I didn't feel overloaded, I felt like I was simply thinking more efficiently ... because I was - remember, this drug is made for people with ADD, as a substitute for Ritalin).  I was still taking wonderful notes (my handwriting got much better by the way) and I was still listening to the Prof., but all 'goodness' in the chest had gone, I realized I hadn't noticed it in a while.  So I figured the desired recreational effects had worn off.

I was wrong.

We then had a break for 5 minutes at 7:30.  As I stood up it all came back to me, rolling over my chest in a whoosh (the tightening, goodness, etc).  As soon as I started moving, and I mean as soon as, like as I stood halfway up, I felt a little out of sorts, and naturally felt excited that the drug was still working.  Well there I went, the excitement was multiplied and I felt damn good.  The best way I can describe it, is I just felt cool and in control, which I most certainly was -- I was content with everything, plus happy on top.  I had no attitude about myself, like 'I'm a bad ass', but I just felt like I was 200% zoned in on what was going on around me, and since my brain was working better I was much more witty and felt extraordinarily good about myself.  As I was leaving the room I was walking head up, shoulders back, not like a noticeable strut, but simply like someone who felt good about himself.  It was a very natural posture (I'm sure of this, I saw myself on a monitor while leaving for the vending machine.  This class is taught by video conference.).

I grabbed a coke from the machine because I had already decided I wanted to take 30mg more.  I decided this back when I thought the recreational goodness was gone, but even now that it was still there I figured what the hell and did 3 more (10mg each):-) (I wasn't craving it at all though, I think this is important to note.  I could have easily stopped there and just came down).  I popped those at 7:36pm.

Oh just a note, whenever I felt excitement, my heart rate rose, nothing dramatic but noticeable and it was pumping fairly hard.  It felt so good pumping in my chest that I wanted to keep nourishing my excitement, but like I said, it wasn't out of my control.  If I needed to chill out I could have just turned it off like that.  Also this whole time I was swiveling side to side in my chair a bit, and when he played music (the class is titled Popular Music in American Culture, and we listened to some great blues music tonight) I had to (as in it felt so good and was so inconspicuous that it would have been a crime not to) tap/move my toes around in my shoes. I also kind of bounced to the beat in my chair.  However, once again I want to stress that if I had to stop it all I could have.

Music sounded great, not like when I was on acid (music sounded unreal to me, it took me to other places and I had no control - some songs I had heard a million times I couldn't even recognize and experienced in a completely different way, but back to A+), but I was experiencing the music in much the same way that conversations were more interesting.  I didn't hear weird noises or make the song out to be more than it was, but I was able to, I guess, respect the song more.  It was like the first time you hear a really great song, when it is still different and special, you get that feeling again, even if you've heard it a million times and it's lost some of it's zing.  Not all songs sounds great though, if it were a bad song, a single interesting instrument or sound wouldn't have kept me interested. 

Class was dismissed at 8:45 and I was feeling good.  Thinking back, as the second dosage really kicked in hard, around 8:00, I got a generally good glow in my chest, which could be intensified by more emotion, but just kind of chilled there in my chest if I wanted it to.  On the way out I made some witty remark to my teacher because he jokingly made some smart-ass remark to me.  I don't remember exactly what it was (just a passing thing I wouldn't have remembered sober), but I do remember my remark was extremely witty and off the top of my head.  Oh, also, something interesting, he always makes jokes at the beginning of class that aren't that great, then towards the middle and end he makes more jokes that no one I mean NO ONE understands.  Well tonight I was the only one laughing at all of them, and he pointed out that I was getting them.  He kept referring to obscure and unimportant things he mentioned earlier in the class, the type of things you hear a person say and immediately (and naturally) disregard because you know they will never come up again, but I was making the connection, no one else was.  I finally understand his humor!

As I was walking home, I was compelled to look around, at the buildings, the sky, the people walking next to me, cars passing by, etc., for no other reason than to just to take them in and be aware of it all.  Also I was walking quite a bit faster than I normally do, not like I was some gimpy fool having some sort of trouble making it to jogging speed, but just a little quicker pace.  I felt the muscles in my legs as they worked, and every time they were flexed I got a subtle yet nicely noticeable warm and pleasurable sensation from them, like stretching after a long movie.  It never turned into a strong pressure though, like it did (at least for me) on acid.  You know, like you know your body (or a specific muscle) is tired, and although it doesn't hurt, you feel the pressure of it flexing extremely hard.  It never got to that point; it just kept flexing and feeling good.

And here we are.  I am still learning and the music is pumping.   As you can tell from this document, I have become very precise and thorough (like the note taking).

I'm trying to think of a basic statement or two that could sum up the whole of the feelings.  It goes a little something like this : All the emotions and feelings (basically everything and anything your body goes through on a normal day) are exaggerated and enhanced to a point at which they are noticeably more intense, more pleasurable, and more worthwhile, but it never overwhelms you to an uncontrollable point.  You are sociable to a point that's not unusual or suspicious, but you are getting much more out of it (living) than you are exhibiting to others.  I'd say it's the perfect drug to do if you want to feel good/cool/in the know/attentive/witty/on the ball//like the proverbial 'man', while in a social setting in which you don't want it to be obvious that you're on anything, or a setting where you still have to get something done. I suppose an even better way of putting it all, if you haven't already got the idea, is you internalize all you feel and think (which is a very substantial amount), and are then able to examine it all and let out only what you see fit, while still enjoying all you are experiencing.


The above was all written (with the exception of some editing as it was originally an email) at around 9:15pm, 4 hours and 15 minutes from the first 30mg dose and 1 hour and 40 minutes from the second 30mg dose.  It did not wear off completely until just now  (read: I have been wide awake and only now felt like sleeping).  It is now 1:49am, 8 hours 45 minutes from the first dose, and 6 hours 9 minutes from the second dose.  It should be noted however that any extremely desirable effects were gone (unless I tried to notice them, and then they were weak) at around 11:30pm.  The deep thinking and astuteness were weaker, but still very noticeable until 1:49am.

The only side effects I have ever noticed when on A+ are lack of hunger and dry mouth (but not like cotton mouth, just noticeably drier).  Forgetting or not having a desire to drink fluids was not a problem.  To restate, the dosage in this experience was 30mg to start, then 30mg approx. 2 and ½ hours later.

I plan to do this again with a higher dosage, probably starting with 50mg or 60mg and feeling it out from there.  When I do I will submit that experience as well.  I am sill gathering information about approximate safety zones as far as dosages, and as this is an amphetamine I would strongly urge anyone who decides to use Adderall without a physicians supervision to be exceptionally careful.  Read up on all aspects of the drug, not simply experiences stories like this one.  Everyone reacts differently to drugs and you should know if you have any risk factors.  You have a big responsibility when you use any drug, so please do your best to make it safe for yourself and everyone else.

Sorry that was so long, but I wanted to be thorough.  


Final thoughts and suggestions: Keep in mind that just because this is a long and detailed document doesn't mean it was an intensely overwhelming experience.  When considering this drug, take the words and phrasings at their face value.  What I am getting at, is don't read more into it than what I have actually written. 

 I think most anyone would enjoy this drug, not only was I able to feel great, but I was actually able to learn better, retaining what I heard in class, not to mention taking incredible notes.  You also appear sober to anyone around you, and personally it was a good way for me to be more attentive, have more fun, and feel generally better without overwhelming my body or mind.








Over the past few weeks I've been lucky to experiment with Salvia. I want to share my experiences with others, as others reports have helped me understand my own relationship with the herb. 

Having tried both the quid method and smoked plain dried leaves with little effect other than mild sensations and unusually high susceptibility to alcohol, my psychonaut partner and I learned more about extraction methods. I highly reccommend The Salvia Divinorum FAQ at lycaeum.org for anyone who is curious about the methods I describe below. 

Our first series of experiments came from a home-extracted 25g batch. (We presently use denatured alcohol as our solvent medium) This was probably a 5x batch. 

My first experience was rather late at night with just my partner and I home. The living room light was on, but no music or television. He packed a bowl for me in a glass pipe,(after since experimenting with both a glass pipe and a water pipe, I have to agree with him that a glass pipe works better with extrated enhanced leaves than a water pipe.) I took two deep hits. Apparently I tried to get up, and he told me to sit back. I believe this set the mood for my quick trip to neverland. 

My attention was turned to a gathering. I had a distinct impression that I was at a social gathering, but not quite a boisterous party. I don't believe that anyone actually talked to me, but more like communication on such a basic level, perhaps simular to a cellular level. I had the feeling that I had been there before, and that I remembered that sort of twisted sense of non-reality. Suddenly my attention turned to my partner, who got up and walked across the room and back to the couch for some reason.  While he was at the other end of the room I had the feeling that I was actually quite far away, and gradually being pulled back to this 'universe' for lack of a better word. 

As I was leaving my 'neverland', I had a distinct impression that I wasn't wanted there. Perhaps I wasn't ready for that experience. At this point I also became aware of a pins and needles feeling over my entire body. After this experience I decided this was not a party high, and look to each experience with much respect. This is my opinion, but I cannot stress this too much. 

We decided to try it with a light and sound machine a few days later. I took a 3 deep hits. After about two minutes I took the goggles and head phones off. I remember doing this with much determination. Once again I tried to get up and my partner tried to keep me calm and on the floor. Something was terribly wrong with the situation (I believe my senses were too overwhelmed). I remember having a conversation with Todd, my phriend, that they said it was wrong. Who they are and what it is I can only guess. Perhaps the conditions must be right to seek them (perhaps an ally for you Casteneda fans). I walked across the room and sat on the floor, feeling very alien, as if this dimension isn't reality. I had a very 'Matrix' moment. Eventually everything became normal, and I felt at home in my body and with everything around me. 

We got another shipment of dried leaves and made a more precise extraction. I believe this to be a 6x extraction, plus we scraped the residue of the glass baking dish. (I believe this is a soft-tar extract.) I packed the pipe half full with the extract enhanced leaves, then used one quarter the amount with residue. 

(At this point, I like to explain why I continued experimenting given my journeys being at least a little scary to say the least. This has taken a very spiritual turn. I know the spirits, allies, little green  men, whatever you want to call them sound bizare to say the least, and may be considered frightening. They didn't scare me so much as helped me find the right path to them.)

My phriend, Todd, who sees himself as Jonny Appleseed and wants to turn on as many people as he can, has been experimenting with dosages for different people giving the dosages they are ready for. (Of course, he doesn't dose people out of their minds, until they are ready for it.) He helped me with my dosage, which I just described, made sure that I was settled comfortablly on the couch, then turned on some music he had been experimenting with. It was some sort of primordial music that he got online. He then left the room so I wouldn't be effected by him. I took one hit. 

The pins and needles, slanted shift of the world, and other effects I come to expect on the onset took place. I believe I took a second hit. I felt myself being shot somewhere else. I heard  my guides welcome me again, but this time they scared me. I had an awful feeling that I was going to get sucked into another dimension, and I desperately wanted to join reality again. Perhaps my ego is so strong that I have a hard time letting go. Somehow I managed my body enough to get up and run into the other room.  We have a swinging door between the dining room and kitchen. At the moment I pushed the door  open, Todd was pushing the door, trying to see what was wrong. I think I called his name out. 

Suddenly I believed he was keeping me in there. I thought he was in on some secret mission to detain me in some alternate universe. (Yeah, I know how crazy it sounds.) Finally, after a lifetime it seemed I pushed the door open and grabbed him. I knew he would anchor me, and we stood there holding each other. When I became aware of my surroundings, and remembered smoking the salvia vaguely, I realized I was laughing hysterically. Todd had no idea what was going on and we decided to talk about it at the table. 

I was still under the influence. Part of the sense that he had an alterier motive was still with me. I had the awful sense that he wasn't human. I half begged him and half threatened him that if he knew something  he had better tell me. (I laugh now, thinking of it.) It was another 'Matrix' moment. Neither of us liked the idea of my not believing that this reality is real to the point that other people, cats, dogs, children, ect. aren't true either. A rather scary interpretation.








Ok, I ordered a fluid ounce of wormwood extract from an ethnobotanical company. The bottle was marked with poison symbols, which made me a bit apprehensive. I read somewhere that the proper proportions to make the fabled Absinthe was 1 cup of Pernod to 1 teaspoon of wormwood. I didn't feel like buying Pernod, so I cracked open the wormwood bottle and added a teaspoon to a cup of Absolut vodka. The wormwood was very dark and had a very strong odor, kinda minty but with a distinctive edge to it. The oil was very hard to wash off the spoon, it stained it green, and the spoon smelled like wormwood for a while. This worried me, considering I planned to pour it down my esophagus.

I mixed it vigorously, covered the cup in Saran wrap, and placed it in a refrigerator for two days. After the wait, I stirred it up and strained it through a rag, removing a resiny layer that had separated from the mixture. The resultant mixture was a cloudy green, it looked a little like bong water, and smelled even worse. The white plastic spoon I used to mix it was colored green, and wouldn't wash easily. I was getting apprehensive about the stuff, and the smell was making me queasy.

I mixed a shot of the mixture with lots of water and sugar. It did not turn opaque white, as I read it should. Summing my courage, I started drinking the 16 oz concoction. It had a strong taste much like the smell of wormwood, and made my stomach very queasy. Every sip I took made me gag and make sour faces. I don't know if my reaction was psychological because I was afraid of the stuff, or if I just didn't like the taste, or if the stuff really was bad for me and my body was complaining. I put red Kool-Aid crystals in it to make it more palatable, but it didn't help. I gave up after a quarter of the cup.

I think I got a buzz off it, there was a drone in my head and I felt like I was on painkillers, but I think I need to drink more. I ate alot of food and drank water afterwards, but the horrible taste was hard to get out of my mouth, I think it coated my alimentary canal like it did the spoon. This thought was not pleasant.

I think I am going to just try and down a shot of the wormwood and vodka without diluting it, and hope I don't vomit it out. That will take some courage, though.

Does anyone have any experience with this, did I do anything wrong? Any suggestions or dire warnings? If I don't get any negative feedback, I'm just gonna down the shot and hope for the best, and then post the results.

I'm open to ideas and suggestions. Wish me luck!







My purpose with this report is to try to dispel any notion that absinthe will produce an effect similar to cannabis or to any hallucinogen. People who are looking for an 'absinthe high' will be truly dissapointed, as well as people who are steeping dried wormwood or essential worwood oils in alcohol, the result of which will only be some foul tasting stuff.

I will report on three commercial brands (produced in countries where absinthe is legal): Hill's from Czech Republic, Lasala and Deva from Spain.

Hill's is nothing more than some strong vodka (140 proof) with food coloring. It will only get you drunk fast and give you a hell of a hangover in the morning.

Lasala (100 proof)is a better product. It is yellow and turns to a milky light yellow when mixed with water. After three glasses (1 part absinthe and 3 parts water) dunk with friends lent to stimulating conversation and nothing more.

Deva (100 proof) reportedly has the highest thujone (the active ingredient of wormwood) content of any absinthe in the market (I am familiar with approximately a dozen brands). It is definetely the best quality of the one's that I've tried in taste, apperance and effect. Poured out of the bottle it is green in color with a stong smell of both anise and woormwood. When mixed with water it turns (louches) into a milky pearly white liquid with a touch of green (a beautyful visual effect).

The 'absinthe effect' is very subtle. YOU DO NOT GET HIGH. It's more of a lucidity, speech becomes very articulate and ideas clear. You don't feel drunk. That's it. I like to drink with friends and perhaps go out to a club afterwards to have a nice sociable time. It takes me a little while to go to sleep after a night of drinking absinthe. The next morning I usually wake up relaxed (not wanting to get out of bed) but without any hangover.

Nice drink if you ask me.







I made some Absinthe by simply adding ground wormwood to Pernod. I let it sit for a day before filtering out the mush and bottling the liquid. I had had Absinthe before but I couldnt stomache it so I thought a friend of mine should give it a try.

We were at another friends house when 'm' and I decided to bust out the juice. I shot down two glasses and he managed to get down four. About five minutes later I heard him call from the living room, 'Nate, I'm trippin' man'. He told me that the carpet had grown like a weed about 11 inches. He said that everything was swirling together and elongating. 

The reason I dont know more than this is because he blacked out. He still cant remember anything now, a month later. He also got pretty ill the day afterwards so be carefull with this one.







On Saturday a friend of mine and I decided to do some Amanita Muscaria that I had purchased from a supplier. I had read an obsessive amount of literature on it, including Wasson's Soma. Divine Mushroom of Immortality. Yeah right. After boiling 52 grams of dried mushrooms in water for an hour, my friend ingested 22 grams of the soup and the mushrooms. I quaffed down the remainder. 30 grams that is. I'd tried 8grams before and since I didn't die of renal failure, I decided 'hey, whatever. If Im gonna do it, do it right'. A dictum my friend and I always stuck by since our drug fueled college days. This was at 1:45 PM The concoction was the most disgusting thing I have ever had the displeasure of tasting. 'Yeach'.

At 2:25 PM I started feeling nauseous and lay down on an Oriental carpet. The Stone Roses were playing on the CD player. The nuasea seemed to emanate from both my head and stomach. As I lay writhing in this most unpleasant state, my friend was annoying the shit out of me by saying that we should go out 'cos it was a nice day. I was so nuaseated that the music seemed miles away. At one point I felt like puking, but my friend D had gone into the bog to take a crap and so I just lay there writhing. I told him to hurry up and when he was finally done, I ran to the bowl and puked the most painful puke I have ever had. Worse than a heroin or alcohol puke. Once this was done I felt slightly better, but still really bad. We did a couple of bong hits of D's home grown skunk and then I proceeded to lay on the carpet again. At this point D got up and decided to go out.

I lay on the floor listening to the Stone Roses. They were awesome as ever, but since the music was made for tripping on E and since I was kinda feeling a heightened buzz, the music felt literally like a wall of sound. One song in particular seemed unravelled. There seemed no begining or end. Its difficult to explain. All the instruments and particular sounds seemed non-cohesive and separated. Unravelled.

After a while I started chattering and shivering. It became really cold and the area right above my groin started to feel acutely painful. I don't know my anatomy, but started to wonder if this was where my kidneys were located and whether I was going to have renal failure. [Erowid Note: the kidneys are located along the spine in the lower back, so this doesn't sound like a kidney problem.]

I was so cold and shivering I finally got the courage up to get up and head for my bed. I lay under a thick blanket on a sunny spring afternoon and since I was feeling really drowsy and since I was feeling really nauseated I tried to pass out. I did for about what I think was two hours. At one point I got up to shut a window and realized that I felt physically powerful and felt a numbness in my hands. (My arms and hands seemed to have more strength in them than usual.) But the dread of nausea was so great I didn't want start jumping around or do anything physical.

As I lay passing in and out of consciousness, I kinda felt my ego/self separated from the rest of my body. This is the only way I can describe it. I felt like my ego was disconnected from the rest of my physical and mental? being. I really don't know exactly how it felt. Like I was looking down at myself and being able to perceive clearly as a third entity, my character and seeing things I should change about myself. Ive been referred to as the angry young man by many of my friends and kinda felt like I was viewing this guy/me who was an angry person. I got the same vibe from him as I do from my dad sometimes.

I don't recall how much time had passed when I woke up, but I didn't feel any nausea and drowsiness. I just lay in bed, with this wierd heightened buzz. It wasn't like a Psilocbin/LSD/E heightened buzz. I would't even call it a trip. It was just this non-psychedelic buzz.

As I lay there I heard D come back. I pretended I were dead in bed and when he came close to examine me I jumped up. Not very funny. We realized that we both had extremely blurry vision. He was at the park and said it was a buzz hassle 'cos all these roller bladers kept on passing him, but he couldn't see them until they were passing by him.

We were both also sweating profusedly and salivating like mad. The shivering/chaterring/chills were still there but not as bad. D was like 'Dude I feel something but Im not tripping. This sucks Thank God for man-made drugs'. I laughed and told him I felt the same. All I felt was this 'heightened' feeling, but it definitely wasn't psychedelic. We both still had blurry vision. All these combinations made me glad that we hadn't gone to the pictures. (Matrix was playing). I was really glad it was fading away and that I hadn't gone out. In one word 'This really sucked!'.

I sat down, put on some Happy Mondays and Oasis on the CD player and proceeded to draw up two lines of Anadenathera Colubrina lines (Cohoba). D didn't want any so I snorted both lines in quick succession. Nothing happened. Absolutely nothing. (By the way I've tried bonging it and smoking it when I was straight, and still nothing.)

Four hours after ingestion, things started feeling normal, but not completely. The blurry vision was still there. So was this wierd heightened, doesn't do it for me buzz. We went out to get some Sushi and beer. The taste was shite and I couldn't and didn't want to finish my beer and sake, let alone the food. After 7 hours we were back to normal, but fried.

Going out to a friends party and a date afterwards was not really a good idea. Fellow psychonauts, try this shroom, but don't do a lot. I think 15g will probably be best. When I did 8g a week before, I felt no nausea, I felt a certain clarity of mind, kinda euphoric and confident, and my perception of the world was tinged with a certain sense of 'holiness'. I also felt energetic at one point and got up and started to do a little jig!. Music was also amazing, like a wall of sound, with some colours.







I was in the woods of oregon and found some A. muscaria, one 'medium sized' mushroom was split between three people (as stated by others, a low dose was desired in order not to be caught off-guard, as it was a first experience for all three people). The cap was about 4 1/2 inches in diameter. the entire mushroom was split between three people, with the smallest person taking none of the stem (thus the other two people consumed more matter).

The effects noted began manifesting shortly, although subtly at first. A distinct nausea was noted by all, which was probably not added to by the consumption of burritos. =)

All three agreed that things appeared to not remain true to their typical proportions, although the smallest of the three individuals appeared to experience it most prominently. that is, although nothing really grew or shrank, things (desk, window, etc.) somehow seemed as though they were bigger or smaller than they were normally.

A body euphoria was experienced as well, although the nausea was the main stumbling block in this experience. Motor impairment was also experienced, although it seemed that said impairment would not detract from the pleasure of movement. Unfortunately, the nausea in the case of the smallest individual was severe enough to prevent the desire for most movement.

Desire for linear conversation also diminished, and the experiencing of the senses dominated the occasion. music appreciation was enhanced, but one of the people opined as to how it was not enhanced to nearly the same degree as would be experienced with lysergic acid, psilocybin-based mushrooms, c. sativa, or GHB.

There was a degree of mental 'discomfort' in the mind of the smallest individual (who most likely took the largest dose based on body weight, despite the attempts to even it out). As described my others a great deal of 'conversational weirdness' took place, in the forms of inadequate expression and unusual lines of conversation. the 'hallucinosis' described occurred also, as previously mentioned. not out-and-out visual hallucination, but rather a sense that things 'seemed' as though one were hallucinating quite prominently. This, I believe, could relate to A. muscaria's reputation as a deliriogen, causing the individuals to *believe* that things were moving and growing/shrinking, although they did not necessarily look as though they were.

Eventually, the smallest person in the dream excused herself to the bathroom to vomit, having not been able to conquer the nausea. She returned and reported that she felt much better, and the experience proceeded without the impairment of that negative feeling. Effects lasted probably a total of three hours. although, this is an inaccurate estimate, since once the three trippers felt they had returned to baseline, they proceeded to consume 1/4 dried oz each of cubensis mushrooms (spread over a period of one hour).

A. muscaria seemed to be an interesting and different experience from more usual entheogens. It also seemed like something that should be approached with extreme care. A higher dose for the trippers quite possibly would have caused more prominent and possibly unusual effects (such as much more vivid delusions). It seems an avenue worth exploring (from the land of Nod, of course), but also one that should be approached with respect and with caution.







From the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs, Jan-Mar 1976

On two occasions in the fall of 1975, I ingested dried caps of A. muscaria from Washington. The mushroom caps were eaten as `Amanita chips,' and were tasty. On the first occasion, I ingested the chips along with several grams of Psilocybe cyanescens Wakefield from Washington which had been estimated to contain at least 1 percent psilocin dry weight. The effect experienced therefore have no bearing on Amanita toxicity. On the second occasion, I ingested about 30 grams of the dried caps, and after an hour began to experience a very pleasant opium-like sedation with slight visual phenomena, similar to those described for A. pantherina intoxication, although of lesser intensity. I experienced distinct muscarinic effects, characterized by profuse salivation and mild perspiration. Three friends who ingested the mushrooms with me reported similar effects. The muscarinic symptoms were not at all unpleasant. Either these effect were due to muscarine in the carpophores (in which case A. muscaria from Washington must contain a much higher concentration of muscarine than is reported for European specimens), or they were produced by some yet-unidentified compound with muscarinic activity.

Again, I experienced no nausea or other adverse effects. The intoxication was experienced for about five hours, after which I went to sleep and awoke the next morning with no after-effects. During the experience I noticed a rather profound diminution of coordination and balance, effects similar to advanced stages of ethanol intoxication. There were, however, no effects of clouding of consciousness or slurring of speech. One of the friends who ingested the mushrooms with me experienced slight nausea, but no other adverse effects were reported.

In the spring of 1975, after completing the above survey, I collected some early specimens of A. pantherina near Tenino, Washington. I sliced and sauteed the mushrooms, and divided them into six portions, consisting of about one half cup of material each. The six portions were ingested by myself and five friends, one of whom ingested only half of a dose, the remaining half being ingested, along with a full portion, by another of my friends. All of us enjoyed the taste of the mushrooms.

After an hour had elapsed, I had concluded that the dosage level was too low, and had retired to my home to build a fire and study. About 90 minutes after ingestion, however, while hyperventilating into my wood stove in an attempt to start the fire, I noticed that I was experiencing changes in visual perception. These effects became stronger over the next hour or some, and were characterized by sensing an `alive quality' in inanimate objects, wavy motion in the visual field like a Van Gogh canvas (no color perception was associated with the motion, however, as is so commonly encountered following ingestion of LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline), and mild distortion of size, distance and depth perception. Auditory hallucination were also prominent -- especially the effect, called `anahata sounds' of yoga, of hearing fine high-pitched sounds like bells and violin strings. I experienced only slight impairment of motor coordination and balance, such as would be produced by a small amount of ethanol, equivalent to two or three bottles of beer. In contrast to the effect of ethanol, however, there was no slurring of speech or clouding of consciousness. While I felt as though my conciousness was somehow removed and distant from the surroundings, I experienced a sense of great clarity, as I often experience following ingestion of psilocybin-containing mushrooms. It seemed to me that the psychic effect were emanating from the `ajna chakra', the so-called `third eye' -- a locus above and between the eyes. I experienced no muscular spasms, cramps, vomiting, or nausea of any kind. The experience was totally pleasurable, and lasted about seven hours. I was struck by the unique quality of the effect whereas I find the psychic effects of LSD, psilocybin-containing mushrooms, and peyote to be similar, to be, as it were, on a continuum of related experience, I felt the A. pantherina was distinctly different.

Of my five friends, two experienced slight nausea, and only one felt drowsy. This person slept for about an hour, and awoke feeling refreshed. Two of my friends alleged that they had never been so high on hallucinogenic drugs before. One of these friends, the person who ingested half again as much of the fried mushrooms as I, experienced a complete dissociative reaction, and was unable to communicate with the rest of the group for about five hours. While in this state, he was periodically attempting to articulate his thoughts, but was totally incapable of communication. During this phase of his intoxication, we were talking about this history of A. muscaria and urine ingestion in Siberia. The subject in the dissociated state later reported the experience of vivid waking dreams which were related, through bizarre imagery, to the topics of the conversations we had been conducting around him. After about five hours of dissociative experience, the subject began to reestablish contact with the rest of us and within 90 minutes was fully rational, though shaken and frightened. None of us experienced any after-effects.






This was supposed to be a below-threshold test, but ended up stronger than expected.

EFFECTS:
Relaxed but not 'tired.' 
Flushed face (almost like having run around the block or something)  
Slight motor impairment (nothing 'heavy,' but making typing a bit of a chore)  
Zero logic impairment (fully able to play logic games competitively, do math, etc.)  
Suggestibility (Easy to wander off into unsolicited conversation) 
Conversational weirdness (Difficulty picking 'the right word' (A feeling of not being able to express oneself 'properly.' nobody else noticed this however.)  
Minor hallucinosis (if you could call it that. he could not actually point out something and say, 'there, _that moved_.' it just SEEMED like stuff was moving. note: there was an earthquake at about the time he was having such thoughts.)  

DURATION: 
no more than 6 or 7 hours.

COMMENTS: 
No hangover was noticed. Sleep came easily. dosage was taken pulverized in gelcaps with milkthistle.







Petri's updated preparation info also available

Over in Finland A. muscaria grows all over the place - it's very common and it's maybe the most common mushroom that you can find in city area (it's grow in parks, woods, cemeteries, etc.). At first time we (one friends of mine and I) took about five grams of dried cap and smoked some pot (to prevent nausea and to potentiate the trip. We didn't get much out of it so we tried two week later 15g each and only the best part of the mushroom - yellow flesh just under the skin (we ate skin too but I think it doesn't change the experient in anyway because there is so little of it). Both times we made soup out of the mushrooms. All you people should also remember they say that American and European mushrooms contains different amount of different alkaloids in them ... but they also say that it's FDA/DEA's rumour to make people to think that American ones are toxic.

Anyway - the trip was weird. It was kind of sleepy, but not like I have heard people telling that it's makes you to go very sleep like state with losing your memory. Mushrooms made me feel nausea, but this was prevented with pot. Nausea from A. muscaria was pretty bad so we waited as long as we could and then smoked pot and after one toke it was gone! Pot works somehow for all the nauseas but it's totally awesome for A.muscaria. We smoked some more pot though because we figured out that it blows us much higher than only the shrooms. Trip was hallucinating but there was no color patterns and other visuals. It was more like hallucinating in the mind and other ones were very real like we saw fog all over the place (we were hanging around the town) and we saw that water on the pavement was frozen, but later we heard that there was neather fog nor temperature below 50F. When I'm talking about 'we' I really mean it - WE BOTH SAW THOSE THINGS and I can't think why it was like that. One example of those in-mind hallucinations that I saw ... no I imagined that there was open field with red colored devils coming out of the ground and smiling to me. It was very wierd all those devil looked totally the same and there looked like devil should :) - They had horns, there skin was likes fish's skin and they had that 'devils fork' on their hand. That was kind of funny/scarey, but it didn't last more than few seconds.

The trip was also very confusing. We lost sense of the place and we got lost in my hometown that we knew very well. Next morning we remembered where we had been, but on the trip we didn't. My friend also got lost on the parking lot were I left him while I was going to buy some fast food (he was scared to go with me to the fast food place because there were too many people). When I came back he was like 'oh thanks! I didn't know how to get out of the parking lot'. The Trip was also very euphoric, aphrodisiactic and funny. We were laughing very spontaneously and at one moment we just started to laugh with no reason and then we ran away because we were in public place and there was people. At one moment I even felt that I couldn't prevent to cum in my pants - it felt that good! (I didn't come in my pants though ... really :) ). Anyway when I bought that fast food we went to eat near by the soccer field and my friend told that the field was glowing yellow and there was men playing soccer (one of those 'in-mind' hallucinations) and I was hearing the sounds of the game.

I haven't take it for two years because I thought that it's toxic and bad for brain cells (so is ethanol, but I don't do that either). It would be really nice if someone had information about it's long time toxity. Now when I refreshed my memory I remember that it was nice I'll maybe do it again at next fall! Next time I would like to take more though (maybe 20-25 g), but I'm kind scared because of it's possible toxity.







Recently, I ordered 30 grams of Yellow Fly Agaric mushrooms. I started off by eating two caps and continued to eat two caps every hour because I wasn't feeling anything. After consuming 20 grams of mushrooms, caps primarily, I started sweating for no reason an hour after consuming the last cap. I changed into something cooler. I then started getting the cold chills. I just couldn t decide if I was hot or cold and couldn t relax. I kept shaking from the cold but felt totally hot at the same time. Once this went away after two hours from when the last cap was ate, the started getting a mild drunk feeling. It was much more pleasant and euphoric than being drunk. As for the hallucinogenic qualities, they are hard to explain. 

Everything looked like it was moving around, but I couldn t tell you one specific object that moved at any one time. I had some hallucinations of size. When one of my friends stopped by when I was peaking, his head just appeared to get smaller and further away then it was when I talked to him. Whereas, when I was sitting on the couch, the coke can on my roomate s desk got bigger and appeared closer than what it actually was. I was much more aware of color and sounds but no where as near as much as when on LSD. As for my behavior, I m pretty sure it was different than that of any other persons. When I get hyper, I tend to act pretty nuts around people. The mushrooms made me very energized, so I was going around wanting to pick a fight with everyone on my dorm floor. I was joking around for the most part. I was also moody. I d go from being totally smiley and giggly to being pissed off at the world. I also had trouble holding back what I wanted to say. I got my roomate so mad because I kept calling him a queer over and over because I was bored. Video games were enhanced greatly. 

Rainbow Road on Super Mario Kart was never interesting to me before, but it was so neat while on fly agaric mushrooms. The best way to describe the effects of these mushrooms was delirium. I was basically delirious the whole time and most of the effects seemed to be in the mind. I was still pretty messed up when I went to sleep. I had no trouble sleeping, but the next morning I had a mild hang over similar to that of alcohol. I believe it was a great experience and was worth the experimentation, but I think I will stick to psilocyban mushrooms. 







: i disagree strongly with the person who says these amanita muscaria 
: mushrooms did nothing and were not worthwhile i have had first hand 
: experience with these mushrooms and would strongly urge caution in even 
: picking them, these are hardcore poisons, and serious hallucinogens. do 
: not take theses mushrooms lightly as they will kill you if you do not 
: know what your doing with them. this is no joke.

Nonsense! I have around 30 pounds of Amanita Muscaria sitting in my freezer right now. They were first cleaned, then dipped in brandy to preserve them. I eat some nearly every day, they have an extraordinaryly rich and subtle flavor, they taste wonderful. I usually eat about 2 tablespoons per meal, maximum around 4, and I can tolerate up to about 8 tablespoons a day. Fly Shroom is roughly as toxic (when potent) as coffee. Are you afraid to handle green coffee beans because of concerns for caffeine poisoning? Fly Mushroom has roughly the same toxicity level. You could get pretty dire effects from eating a pound of A.M. , but I daresay the effects of eating a pound of coffee are equally dire! 

Fly Mushroom seems to be too harsh (in large doses) for most people to use as an entheogen, but it makes a wonderful tonic when used in small amounts. It is especially welcome in cold weather. It warms you up, energizes you, and makes you feel cheerful. I know no finer tonic for seasonal depression or Christmas blues. If you have to work hard in severe winter weather, it combines very well with red ginseng. The major precaution is that it can potentiate medications whose primary effect is on the nervous system, so don't use it if you are taking this kind of pharmaceutical. Fly Shroom amplifies mood quite a bit, if you take it in trembling and dread, this mood will be amplified and you will feel sure that it is something truly demonic. Many cases of A.M. poisoning are really nothing more than amplified hysteria.

I have given it to a lot of people under relaxed conditions in food, and I have had consistantly positive results. Even when people say they feel nothing, they become much more cheerful and talkative. Your attitude reflects thousands of years of taboos against this mushroom. You are unable to undo the conditioning you inherited from the Collective Unconscious. As for me, I think Soma is one of Gaia's greatest gifts to us. 

I have a passionate fondness for this mushroom! I don't use it as a psychedelic (too harsh), but it is an absolutely superb tonic. (used in modest amounts) I collect at least a dozen different types of wild mushrooms for food use, but this is my absolute favorite. You should cautiously test your reaction (like, try a teaspoon or so) before experimenting with my ideas.

I generally slice up about 2 tablespoons of fresh ( or FlyShroom preserved by dipping in brandy and freezing--it doesn't taste good dried) and sautee it in butter or olive oil. The most you should consume at any one time is about 4 tablespoons. If you feel nausea or dizzines (or hyper and nervous) reduce the dose to what you are comfortable with. You will get far better results using several divided small doses than one big dose. The flavor is exquisite and elegant (I think only the morel really compares) and a dish prepared with FlyShroom will quickly make you feel full--I think it has potential for dieting. FlyShroom also lends itself to as a flavoring agent to fine French and Italian food. It goes really well in rich sauces and with pasta. For a harmless flavor enhancing effect, add a teaspoon or so to a salad dressing or near the end of cooking to a rich savory dish.

Fly mushroom can be taken in food up to 4 times a day (don't overcook!) for a maximum dose of about half a cup. It has a potent warming/activating effect and is best used in the cooler months. If you suffer from cold weather or winter depression, I think you will find it a marvelous tonic remedy for such conditions. You can use FlyShroom in moderation continously for many days, and it will have a wholesome, invigorating tonic effect on mind and body (especially during cold weather). If you stop taking it suddenly, the effects will wear off gently in three days with no withdrawel or 'crash' type reactions. I have not experienced craving effects so I believe the habit-forming potential is low. FlyShroom combines very well with high-quality ginseng, and such a combination can give you great endurance if you face hard conditions.

FlyShroom has the potential to exaggerate the effects of drugs with strong central-nervous system effects, so it should not be used by people who are taking such medicines, especially drugs used to treat psychiatric conditions. There is no problem with using it with moderate amounts of coffee or wine; it adds considerable brightness to the 'zing' of caffeine and mellowness and euphoria to a glass of wine. The basic effect is a cheerful energy and a subtly expanded awareness that combines with a great sense of peacefulness. You feel self-confident, cheerful and serene. It seems to act primarily on the higher brain centers and is great for meditation and contemplation. There is often a subtle sense of tension in the muscles and a desire to do something physically active. At first, you may not be aware of the effect, but people around you will notice how much more talkative and happy you are than you were before. I have used Aminita Muscaria daily for months and have not experienced any tolerance effects. It seems to be wholesome and life-enhancing when used properly.

It is a real treat to read the Soma hymns of the 9th book of the Rig Veda under the influence of FlyShroom. I am convinced that this is the true Soma and not the heavy, leaden, sickliness of Syrian Rue. As it says in the Rig Veda, Soma is a good tonic for the ill. Taken when ill or tired, FlyShroom will act as a sedative/analgesic in a way that reminds me strikingly of codeine. If you take FlyShroom for the first time in the evening, it will act as a stimulant and may interfere with sleep. If you have been taking it during the day, a final dose will make you drowzy and usually give you wonderful vivid dreams. I usually wake up feeling healthy and refreshed the next day. If you push the dose to the maximum you can comfortably tolerate over a couple of days, you will feel a very definite but pleasant sense of intoxication. Vision will be enhanced, especially at night, and you may see colorful visuals with your eyes closed, the images will look like they are encrusted with glowing gems.

Anyway, I think you can see why I am so passionately fond of the Mighty Amanita. I have shared it with a dozen people and nobody has experienced untoward or negative reactions. People who are into recreational drugs often say they feel nothing, but the change in their behavior is really striking. I have never used it in large doses, every time I tried increasing the dosage above a certain level, I get queasy and apprehensive, like the feeling you get when you are in an old house all alone and hear furtive noises. My family likes it, especially my sister and my mother. She also collects wild mushrooms, and will sometimes hide the FlyShrooms so I don't hog them all. Everybody I have given them to has treated them with respect, nobody has been tempted to OD on them.

I think you are barking up the wrong tree in obsessing with using them as a 'entheogen', if you try using them in moderation as a tonic, a whole new world will be opened to you. I think Amanita Muscaria is the positive-energy, 'heavenly' equivalent to the negative-energy, enslaving, 'inferenal' drug cocaine. Nobody thought the stuff was like LSD or 'Magic Mushrooms', but several did compare it to coke. I was concerned, and attempted to 'abuse' FlyShroom to test for signs of tolerance, craving, withdrawal symptoms and other signs of addiction potential. I am happy that neither I nor my collaborators found any! We do, though, have a great nostalgic fondness for the critter, and look forward to a good mushrooming year with gladsome anticipation.

I firmly believe that Soma (nothing else but Amanita Muscaria matches the Hymns) is one of Gaia's greatest gifts from the Northern Forests (when used with RESPECT!), I think its negative reputation results from people not using it with the imagination and respectful moderation that I have, instead trying unsuccessfully force it into being a substitute for the totally different Psilocybe mushrooms. Try my ideas and see for yourself...

Lingam Indrasya! 
Yours in the Name of Sweet Mother Gaia and Life,

I recently found a treasure growing in my back yard. I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks with a lake in my back yard. Many different kinds of mushrooms grow in my back yard. one i happened to notice was a psychedelic variety named the 'fly agaric' Amanita Muscaria. I harvested and dried 4 caps. Around 1:30 pm after i completed the latter process i ate 3 1/2 caps over 6 slices of homemade pizza with a glass of whisky and coke. I continued back to school for my final period of the day. During that period i felt extreme nausea and salivation. A light trippy buzz followed till someone offered me a hit of LSD which i readily accepted. At that time i realized i must go to soccer practice. I dressed on the field feeling euphoric and dizzy. Then as i started running the distant view became a mesh of undulating colors. I ran as quickly as i could and the distant blur became quickly closer to my vision. The grass seemed to move around in a spiraling fashion changing to brilliant colors of red, blue, and yellow. The people around me became just figures of color and movement and my mouth filled with saliva. The time passed quickly and i returned home for a meal with my mom. The plate and food were as indistinguishable as her words but i struggled and went to my room after dinner. the world went black as I laid down and visions of all kinds started. i lost time then and was brought to consciousness again 2 hours later. i sat on my floor with a voice talking to me. its words i cannot remember but it was coupled with faces whirling past me down the tunnel of my vision. my history notes were spit on and stuck to the insides of my arms but i still ran through my room of psychedelic colors. Thoughts raged through my head at incomprehensible speeds. Till i walked from my room and followed my visions through the house were they ended in the bathroom. The mild visions for the rest of the night were easy to handle after that.







I have been steadily developing an interest in entheogenic and psychoactive matter growing 'wildly' within my country (New Zealand), so I was most happy to find that Fly Agaric (Amanita Muscaria var. Muscaria) mushrooms were in fact endowed with hallucinogenic properties. I had been told as a child that they were deadly poisonous, and I think most people here have heard the same, the result being a generous proliferation of unpicked specimens.

A friend and I went to the local reserve and picked about 10 or 11 generous sized caps, wanting to start with a small dosage, and then increase it dependent on results. We cut out the gills, and dried the mushrooms in an oven, pouring the juice back over the 'shrooms (as recommended by Petri?). We ended up with around 11 grams of dried mushroom, which we added to the top of a small pesto/pasta meal we cooked to prepare our stomachs. I think the meal may have been a bad idea.

At 6:30pm we had approximately 3.5g of mushroom each (three people), and settled back, waiting for effects, aware they were likely to be minor. An hour later we hadn't felt a thing, and were skeptical of anything happening. 2 hours later and more of the same. We decided that we'd smoke a J since we were getting bored, and we did notice that we felt a little 'more than stoned'. At around 10:45pm I felt a very fleeting, yet distinct, 'size distortion' while standing in the kitchen, and one of my friends commented that she did aswell. We had another smoke, still feeling 'more than stoned', or perhaps just an augmented stone, and planned our next foray into the park.

I've gathered more now, and I'm going to try the next dosage at 6gms with no meal. I'm unsure whether we dried the mushrooms too much, whether we are at a late point in the season, or whether it was just a combination of low dosage and too much food - but at least we know they aren't 'deadly poisonous'. I'll keep you informed.









I feel a little guilty about submitting this since I haven't been able to read the entire experience archives and have no way of knowing if this is a rather common experience or not.

For me it was a new way to take acid.  

I love acid, but I usually have a problem finding time to have a whole trip Micro dots are like litte aspirin pills of acid and they can, we realized be crushed up and snorted.  This way the trip hits a lot faster and lasts a lot less time.  something to try if you ever get a hold of some dots.







The first time i rolled was at my christmas ball. It was definitely better than going to some club because all of my friends were there. I took my roll as soon as i got there and about a half hour later i just felt like talking to everybody. My date and about half my table was rolling to so whenever we sat down it was non stop talking about what was going on. I started drinknig water because everyone told me to but i didn't really want it. My advice is drink it anyway and have some gum. I was biting my face off which doesn't look good when 5 teachers are staring at you. So anyway, i must have danced to every song they played. I felt like i was completely insync with the beats and rythms. I was grinding with everyone. Even girls, but they knew i was on e so they just went along with it. I thought i'd be shaky and nervous but it was the opposite. I was completely relaxed and extremely happy. I just felt like my life was gonna get better. I was so optimistic. I knew i would do it again. And since then i've done it 4 times. But let me tell you, nothing can compare to the first time. The best part for me now is the very beginning and then about 2 hrs after. I have periods where i am extremely restless and aggravated and i just can't decide what i want to do. I feel like 'why did i even do this' and normal things irritate me. I feel like the world is just a bunch of shit and nothing is fun or worth doing. I get extremely angry when i think about going to school the next day or to work. I only want to be around people who are rolling. Don't get me wrong it's a great drug but just be careful with it.







part i: electric boogaloo in the stars, kid.

chemical cocktail consumed

1) 10mg amphetamine (oral)
2) 10mg d-amphetamine (oral)
3) ~10mg d-amphetamine + .5mg lorazepam (nasal) + 900mg gabapentin (oral)
4) indeterminate amount of nicotine (smoked/sublingual) + saline solution    (nasal)
==  an alternate plane

in addition I take 225mg venlafaxine a day for 'depression.' How that effects this voyage I am not sure.



in the beginning

it's exam week now, and so I have lots of work to do. Absurd amounts of work, one might say. What better way to study than to take a little bit of speed? Several of my friends have a script for it, so I borrowed some. 
First I take two 'adderall,' the blue pill of half d-amphetamine, and for some reason beyond me, half l-amphetamine. Since l-amphetamine has almost no cns activity I don't know how this may affect my experience. This is at about 3pm. The pills go down with a little mango sunny delight. Thereafter I experience typical low-dose amphetamine effects; logorrhea, increased cognition, and the sort. It's what they give it to add children for, no?



later that day

I get a ride from a friend to his house. We each take two dexedrine spansules and chew them thoroughly so as to thwart the wax matrix that keeps the d-amph hostage inside. This happens at about 4pm. I have two more spansules in my pocket for later. He gives me also three pieces of nicorette gum (nicotine polacrilex, 2mg) for potential later nicotine fixes. We go to the local library. He studies cryptography; I study chemistry. We accomplish much this day, in no small part thanks to the d-amph. My heart is beating furtively as it so often does under the tutelage (so to speak) of kind d-amph. Also, I am rather flushed and warm. D-amph does this too. A few cigarettes throughout help mellow the ride somewhat. They take the sinister edge off of the d-amph. 7.30pm I arrive home.



in the house

my parents notice that I smell strongly of cigarettes and my own bodily odours. I notice moreso that, in the process of studying chemistry, I have worked myself into a sweat. I didn't know I could get that deeply into an abstract concept. It's nice to know. In any case, I take a shower. I cleanse myself thoroughly. Ritual cleansing, bordering on obsessive-compulsive, is another typical d-amph thing. Meanwhile, I have started chewing my first piece of nicorette. Everything gets wiggly, like nicotine will do.

Now I am clean. I talk with the parents for a while; about politics, chemistry, my future. Then I sequester myself in my room so that I may dedicate myself to my studies for a while.



evening-time

this is where things get strange.

From previous experience I have learned that the ideal way to administer d-amph is per the nasal route. There are a few drawbacks to this. One is that I must grind up the spansules in a mortar and pestle. This means I get nasty bits of wax up my nose. The other problem is the high peak plasma levels of amphetamine associated with nasal administration. It makes me jittery and less able to work than I otherwise would be able to, sans that powerful all-encompassing shake. It's as if the whole world gets rather...jittery. It comes to fit my mood.

The solution? I'll grind up my nightly dose of ativan with the d-amph -- just .5mg. That smooth benzodiazepine action should take the edge off of the amphetamine without reducing my head to mush. Administered orally it does just that. 

Per nasal, though, was entirely different.  I divide my concotion into four lines and inhale deeply. Occaisionally thereafter I use saline nasal drops in order to (in theory) enhance absorbtion -- it offers a better medium for the chemicals to perfuse the mucous membranes than the plain lactose and wax it would otherwise have. If nothing else, it reduces or eliminates the bright-orange snot that I would otherwise exude for a day. The nasal membrane is a finicky one. For about ten minutes it was typical speed -- I organise, eat a 'nutri-grain' bar since I realise I haven't eaten since lunch-time. Purely objective, rational thoughts control my mind. After that the lorazepam starts to make itself known.

I've snorted benzos before; they hit faster and last about as long as they normally do. This time was different, though. My psychiatrist put me on gabapentin to help with my funky temporal lobes. Its modes of action are unknown at this point. Whatever it does -- placaebo, increased synaptic levels of gaba, binding at some novel neuroprotein -- it makes benzos stronger, almost exponentially so. 



in the darkness

once the lorazepam starts working I enter a state completely unlike any other I have experienced before -- and I like to pretend, if nothing else, that I am a relatively well-experienced psychonaut. The amphetamine makes everything coherent and yet I am on a different plane from my surroundings. I play a mix tape from a friend that arrived in the mail today and try to interact on irc. I say heh a lot. Little else. I give up on the irc idea.  I chew more nicorette, wait a little while, and savor the sensation
the tape is a mix of all sorts of indie-rock goodness. It is raw. I notice this. There are edges to everything, nuances I do not notice otherwise. More than anything else, the repetitive parts of the music become more pronounced. The beats, or a chorus, perhaps, or a sample played over and over. I enter a trance state. The music controls me. Everything else in the environment becomes an extension of the music. It's like the inverse of synaesthesia. Things do not blend into each other. They only become extensions of one greater concept, extensions of some godhead whose power I can only imagine. 

For a moment I shift back into the domain of the real world. It is a fluid transition, like a tidal shift, back and forth, slowly but distinctly. My boat either floats or runs aground. The nicorette goes into the trash can; I wash my hands as a ritual movement. It is beyond my control now. With the addition of the nicotine, everything has become an automatic movement. Consciousness exists, everything is well-deliberated and contemplated. I am just completely dissociated from it. 

This sensation is not like ketamine, dxm, nitrous, or any other typical dissociative. There is none of the out-of-body floating. If anything, I have become more rooted in the world.

After a moment I start browsing at the lycaeum and happen upon the trip reports. I think, 'this is novel enough to merit a trip report.' And so I start writing. It flows without thought. Even now it does the same. Time has lost all reference; space has lost its dimensionality. Everything is one thing. Everything flows into each other; the part is inseperable from the whole.

After writing for a while I go outside to smoke a cigarette. The parents are asleep; I can smoke (outside) unfettered. Outside is a lovely world. There is snow melting on the ground and trees everywhere.

After a few drags off of a pall mall -- my potent nicotine dispenser of choice -- the world changes again, dramatically. I smoke more quickly than I normally would. In the past, I have usually experiences slight flattening of perception and minor visual distortions from this sort of nicotine intake. This time, the world becomes magical. There are stars, and the moon is out. They glitter with a shine that otherwise could not -- should not, almost -- exist. It is otherworldly. An aeroplane crossing through the branches of the trees becomes a shooting star. Its lights become trails that blink intermittently as the branches obscure my view of the plane. Ashing the cigarette becomes a mystical experience as well; the red-hot ash falls to the ground as lava spewing from a volcano. As the ash flickers and fades to grey it emits a spray of light. Even moving my head at this point creates a monochrome kaleidescope -- everything is in shades of grey (it is dark outside at this point. I do not know what time it is; time has become superfluous). Sometimes a flicker of color interrupts this grey miasma. It flashes across my consciousness forcefully, sending a shudder through my body. These flashes of color are reality. Everything else is its backdrop; a sort of ether through which consciousness may flow freely, grasping at the ephemeral bursts of existence that perfuse the ether. 

And then there is now. After the cigarette, I come back and sit down to finish the trip report. The monitor is shimmering and shifting; where there is a flat background colors appear. There is a persian rug intermittently covering the screen, a rug in green and red and yellow and blue and all the other colors. Sometimes things flash across the world. There are blobs, but mostly there are lines. A centimeter or two of bright against the perpetual grey. 



postscript

postscript is perhaps a misleading title; i'm still 'tripping balls' as I type it. The intensity is less than it was, though. The experience has been one of thanatos: the boundaries exist between objects in the world -- indeed, between myself and the world -- are negated. This is nothingness. Through this nothingness, though, there is an element of reality that will not -- can not -- be subdued so easily. Existence may be an artificial construct, but it is a logical one. As much as I try to deconstruct the godhead that is this world, it will not budge. At some level there is an internally congruent layer of existence in the universe. Whether this congruency rises from the internal world, from the psyche, from myself; or if it is a product of the external world, I cannot tell. I cannot even tell if the two are seperate entities.

On a psychological-pharmacological level, methinks the amphetamine offers the ability to analyze objects critically, while the lorazepam -- with the aid of gabapentin -- eliminates that which seperates one perception from another. 

Nicotine, though, seems to be the keystone of the mix, so to speak. While under the influence of nicotine, the tendency toward analysis and bifurcation (everything _is_ or _is not_) of the amphetamine and the muddling effect of the lorazepam (everything is everything) are reconciled. The sensory perturbations which nicotine induces offer fodder for the other chemicals to bite upon, as it were. Through nicotine, the world has cast itself in a new mold; a mold without the nagging inconsistencies and incongruencies of the old. This new world is, in a sense (in many senses, really) more real than the old.

What remains to be seen is what happens tomorrow. That, though, will be another story.

It is 11.45pm now; i shall take 5mg diazepam, to assist sleep, and contemplate this experience further tomorrow.



phase II: the next day

i take that 5mg diazepam and pass out in 45 minutes. exactly four hours (to the minute!) later i wake up to find that my alarm clock is flashing. in the quasi-opiate-orgasmic state i was in the day before i must have accidentally jostled the plug enough to temporarily cut the flow of the electricity. oops. i toss and turn for a little while and find morpheus will not take me back into his arms. enough of that.

i masturbate (it's surprising that my penis worked at all, considering how much speed i've taken this week) and play simcity until 6:30am, when i would typically get up and out the door for another day of school. i yawn and get a ride from my mother to school, occasionally nodding off and shaking neurotically. stupid driver's license. 

in any case, upon arriving at school i see my girlfriend. she had a present for me in the form of five tylenol #3 (with codeine!). and on the day of my history and english exams. at that! opiates have always given me this dreamy-yet-rational state perfect for reasoning through a humanities course. what's a boy supposed to do, eh? i take four and one 10mg Adderall and then  head down to my english class. the codeine starts working -- not as well as it could have, since i'd been using earlier in that week some dilaudid from another friend -- but enough to give me some 'massive buzzage,' so to speak -- in any case, it hit during the fill-in-the-blank short answer portion of the test. all of a sudden the whole mindless-regurgitation bit got more interesting. once i finish that it's off to a computer to write two essays. normally they would be the sort of mind-numbing literary 'criticism' drivel i shove out five days a week, but with the help of brother codeine and sister speed, they become the stuff of which dreams are made. i dispense two custom made essay-bodies and have some of the more intense scholarlyly-enhanced pleasure-waves of my life. they were almost as nice as the year before, when i'd taken percocet with my physics final. 

the sensations this time were more coginitive than usual -- speed does that, i have found. where normally i would experience an intense full-body sense of contentment and overall 'can-do' spirit, this was different. it came from the act of creating and associated strictly with those elements involved in that creation. i had visions of my brain lighting up, cortex aflitter with light. maybe it was the nicotine gum that did it, but it was a minor flashback to the visual play of the night before.



the end

now that i read the above, i realize how extremely fucked-up i was. cliche? hell yes. but the substances involved were atypical. it was what i would have expected mixing ketamine and 2-cb, say, but not two substances so relatively benign as amphetamine and lorazepam. i suggest the combination to anyone so interested. if the general state is replicable, i'd be interested to hear it.








In my height of drug experiences some of my friends and i got lucky with a lot of different drugs one evening. Some coming from some girls we knew and some from a city nearby, and the nitrous from a local hospital. I got ahold of some strong wet blotter with felix the cat inprinted on it and dosed on the way to the private party. We had the tank in the back of the truck and i had a small bit of hash that i got from a local chick that was cool. The hash was kinda sweet tasting and was a nice change from weeks of weed smoking. We arrived with alot of energy from the acid and smiles all around. 

Needless to say we were all pretty excited,and as the night went on we played frisbee in the field next to my friends house with chem. Lights that we cracked open and rubbed on the frisbee so we could see it at night and get those crazy tracer's thats fun to see.I took a break and remembered the nitrous we had and got a couple of friends that helped me lift it off the truck and drug it to the porch. We all had our ballons and i mean the kind you blow up to make a punching bag out of. We filled it up and from that nitrous and hash mix the visuals were so intense that i am not sure if any of us knew that we were all still there.

Time seemed to hit at a perfect pace and we were all very happy. The beer took of the edge so there was no ego defining crap that usally happens any time alot of people are tripping together. Then right when everything seemed perfect we all heard a loud crack and looked and we saw the nitrous tank had fallen over and it seemed to be expelling violently onto my friend's leg. We all weren't sure what to do. it's like nothing that we saw was making sense even my friend that it was burning i don't think relized it as fast as he should have. Once we got our minds together my friend with this enormous freezing burn was gettin up and trying to understand his injury, well we went inside and tried to get a wash cloth that was wet but neither warm or cold and press it against the burn. it looked wierd his leg in this spot was like goo. After this happening we calmed each other down and went outside to strap the tank up to a tree so maybe if we fell down it wouldn't. We didn't let it kill the evening but i truly could see how when you are so blown away by multipal drugs how easy it is to get lost in your mind even if you are a experienced recreational user....

But keep a smile









I was surfing through your pages here and I ran across the article on LSD and Color-Blindness.  Having color-blindness myself and having done LSD, I thought I'd share with others how my color blindness affects my vision, and what if anything LSD has done for me.

First I will explain my color blindness condition.  I am a red/green color blind person.  This does not mean, however, that I confuse red and green, like in the article that prompted this email.  The best way I can think of to explain it is that I seem to a) confuse similar colors and b) 'forget' the identification of a color.  The most prominent of these are between brown and green, red and brown (sometimes), as well as blue and purple.  If two colors (such as blue and purple) are placed next to one another, I can often tell that they are in fact two seperate colors, though I can't tell which one is purple and which is blue.

Having (hopefully) explained that, I must say that in all my trips colors have appeared brighter or sharper, all beautiful, though I still could not tell blue from purple.  The most likely reason for this is that i've lived with my colorblindness for so long i've stopped trying to identify them.  Also most likely the reason for this is that I can still distinguish between those certain colors but not figure out which is which.

I hope this helps some people better understand one of the few types (yes, there's more then one) of color-blindness.  At the very least it's enlightened at least one person.









Setting: My darkened NYC apartment on a cold winter night.  No music.  Wife (an experienced voyager) present as sitter, along with sleeping dog. 

Set: I had not consumed any other psychoactive substances since a heroic dose of home-cultivated psylocibe cubensis three weeks prior.  I was feeling rather listless, and I was very excited to try this plant, despite several friends' failure to have a breakthrough experience with Salvia over a  period of several weeks.

Dosage: 100mg (accurately weighed), smoked in a water pipe.

Experience: Loaded the bowl with 50 mg, and placed the other half of the dose in a folded rolling paper beside the pipe.  With sweaty palms I fired the bowl until the leaves glowed cherry red, filled the chamber and took in all the smoke (which was quite pleasant, actually).  While holding in the smoke I reloaded the bowl, then exhaled and repeated the process.  I recall glancing up at my curious-looking wife, then opening my mouth to exhale and tell her about the curious taste and the beginnings of a prickly, heavyweight body load, then...

Liftoff.  There was virtually no transition: the room broke up rapidly into hard-edged, earth-toned (green and yellow) patterns, and my conscious ego was instantly erased.  I had no idea whether my eyes were open or closed, and I had absolutely no recollection that I had, just seconds before, smoked something.  In fact, there was no sense of self whatsoever; rather, I felt as if my body had atomized (this was, I think, due to the initial prickly body load, as if my molecules were merging into those of the sofa) and I was part of the swirling mass of universal matter.  Plainly put, I felt like I had died, and it was the most exquisite terror I have ever experienced.  I was strongly aware of an Other, an ambivalent observer who was, I felt, chastising me for what I later realized was disingenuous motivation: the desire for a thrill.  The Other was a kind of cosmic trickster, who seemed to be saying: 'You want to know what this is?  I'll show you, and I don't think you're ready..!
.' I cannot think of any analagous experience, drug-induced or otherwise.  The feeling was almost unbearably intense, and I felt utterly alone, merged with a kind of universal energy stream beyond our earthly dimension, a kind of agnostic reincarnation detached from any religious significance.

This phase lasted about 90 seconds, according to my wife (my head was lolling on the sofa, eyes were open but unfocused). Over the next 2 minutes or so, my ego began its self-defensive reconstruction, and I was gripped by an incredible existential horror: I began to remember that I had once been someone, a being with physical form from a wonderful place, and I desperately wanted to get back to that place.  The room began to reappear, but in pieces; at this point I stood up and began to stumble around the living room, trying to find my way back.  It was all a big joke, this reality thing - I knew that it was all illusion, a shabby movie set of our collective devising.  I saw my wife but didn't recognize her...I just wanted to be back.  

When I returned I was standing in the bathroom doorway, grabbing the doorframe and sweating profusely.  I stripped off all my clothes and paced about the room.  My wife was fairly horrified, and I began giggling and saying 'Oh my god  oh my god oh my god...' like a madman.  At T +15 minutes I was more or less 'normalized', but still perspiring heavily.  Vision slightly blurred until T +40, at which point I was able to recount the whole experience to my wife.  Slept incredibly well that night, with unusually vivid, pastoral dreams.

Observations: Salvia is an almost unbearably powerful teacher plant.  I can say without exaggeration that it seriously altered my worldview, and I am now, two months later, still pondering the signifance of my encounter.  I am not a recreational drug user, but I think that my cavalier attitude towards the salvia experience resulted in a trip that was perhaps more intense than it might have been had I approached things with a more respectful attitude.  Also, I'd been reading a lot of pop science (James Gleick's 'Chaos' and Brian Greene's 'The Elegant Universe'), which I think tinged the experience with a distinct materialist/agnostic feeling, although I certainly can't explain the presence of the Other/Overmind.  It was neither good nor evil, but rather profoundly ambivalent.  I have since begun a reassessment of my thoughts regarding religious experience and the afterlife.  

Recommendations:  A respectful attitude is essential, as is a sitter: I could have very easily stumbled out of my apartment and into the street while trying to 'find my way back'.  Prior psychedelic/entheogenic experience strongly advised.







I normally wouldn't bother to submit a story to something like this, but after reading some of the experiences, i felt i had something to share. It was about a week ago, and i was going to do E with my boyfriend, who had done it before, and my friend who hadn't. I was generally used to the effects and new what to expect. About 35 minutes after ingesting 1 and 1/2 pills, the feeling hit me quicker than ever. The E was extremely good, and it felt almost like the first time. The only problem with me on Ecstacy is that when I come down, I crash. I'm extremely restless, and don't know what to do with myself. This time, when I began to come down, I smoked part of a joint to calm myself down. When the high began to hit me, I immediately felt better. I went down the hall with my friend (this was in my dorm) to go to the bathroom. Everything seemed normal, I was laughing and drying my hands. As I walked down the hallway towards my room, a sudden rush came over me. When I got to the room, suddenly my ears popped, I got lightheaded, and almost passed out. As I lay on the bed, I started to freak out, because I didn't know what was wrong - I felt so wierd. But then, as I looked at the ceiling, I realized I knew what was happening to me. I was tripping. It felt just like as if I had been doing shrooms, only the images weren't as vivid. However, it was different. Faces changed into thousands of different faces, and I found I could change something just by thinking about it. I am convinced that smoking marijuana while on ecstacy highly increases hallucinations and makes for a much better experience.







I'm an 18 year old college student. I live in a dorm on my campus and consider myself to have pretty good knowledge of drugs. Thats why I was amazed to find to find that this small campus had a drug that I had never heard of before. I come from a big city and I've done it all but never anything like this. 

I got these white pills from a guy down the hall in exchange for some stuff that I had. The guy told specifically 'split this capsule in half, this is strong shit!'. Well, I was thinking yeah right, I'm 6'5' 220 pounds I can handle one of these pills. So I waited till I had a free night and took it. About 2 hours later at a soroity party it hit me. I did alright for a while. Then about an hour into it I lost all cordination. My head was pounding and I was hearing crazy sounds with bad visuals. 

A couple of my friends took me upstairs to a room to smoke out. The room was tiny and I lost it after 2 bowls. I couldn't get down the steps. My friend carried me to his girlfriend's truck and drove me back to my dorm. I couldn't see, walk, or hear. He carried me up the stairs and put me im my bed. For what seemed like the next six hours I heard the door open and close. I had no motor skills at all and was babling about being stuck in midget land. When I woke up the next morning I was happy to be alive. Be warned this is a powerful drug. It is a ten times more powerful than the best acid I've eaten. Listen to your supplier. Only eat a little.








I had done mushrooms on about 8 different occasions prior to this particular experience. We had just purchased about 2 ounces of mushrooms, and decided we'd eat them later the next night. Well, the next night I ended up buying some more and eating about 2 grams before we even broke into the 2 ounces. After about an hour after eating the first mushrooms I began to feel extremly light headed, and in a euphoric state. So I decided to take some knife hits of high grade cannibis, and to eat some more mushrooms.

The colors at first, were facinating! I had never seen such tracers and patterns before, and was amazed by the bright and detailed color. They seemed so real! But, out of nowhere, the colors dissapeared, and I suddenly felt alone and confused. I could not figure out what was going on. I got scared, and decided I should go home and sleep it off.

After finally finding a ride home, I started to feel a bit better. But as soon as I walked in the house I began to feel scared again. The patterns started to appear again. But now the patterns where consumed in everything I looked at. I was stuck in patterns. My thoughts slowly began to race, I was now unable to concentrate on any single thought. My heart began to race, I felt my soul was being ripped from my body. I thought I was dying, and tried lying down to relax my body, as my mind was telling me, I was preparing my soul for death. Not my body, but my soul. 

I started to feel better, and felt as though I were slowly falling asleep, but all of a sudden I felt a jolt in my body. My ears began to ring. The most violent sound I have ever yet to hear. And in front of me appeared a solid gas sphere of bright colors, with extensions which grew from all sides of the sphere of colors. The sphere disapeared and my room began to sink in. It felt like my room was actually brathing, and I was stuck inside. Everthing I looked at began to shift shape and warp. I was now unable to concieve what was real and what was not. As things were warping, I felt this was the end, I thought I was going to have to kill myself to end it all. 

As soon as the warping ended, I felt a urge to get up and leave the house. I jumped out of bed, sweating, and frantic, grabbed my shirt and began to put it on, only to throw it across the room. I don't know why I did, it kinda felt like the shirt was trying to grow onto me. I felt confused, began to put my pants on, but my hand braced up on some gum which mysteriously got stuck on me, I began to pull it off, unaware that it was gum, and thought I was pulling my skin off. I panicked. My body was deteriorating due to the poisons which I felt were slowly killing me. Once I realising it was just gum, reality began to slowly come back to me. I was begining to finally relize it was just a trip and would soon pass. Over the next 6 hours I experienced flashes off the mushrooms kicking in, but a little less powerful each time, until I finally fell alseep.

For about the next 4-5 months, I experiend random flashbacks, and anxiety attacks. I have eat mushrooms since the experience, but I was alot more careful with my dosage. I have also done acid on different occainsions, but have had pleasruable experieneces every time.

I feel like I made some confrotations with my fears. And feel like I actually got a positive experience out of this. And would one day like to take more, to experinece an even further journey of the mind.







It was my freshman year at college and my friend and I were seriously considering tripping shroom style.  The college I attend is dense with drugs and the like, so getting them was not an issue.  On the night of our foray into psychedelics, we made perfectly sure that all people that were not tripping with us were not around, and the select few that were, were in our dorm room with us.  It was time.  At about 7 o'clock in the p.m., we ate the mushrooms in hamburgers from Hot n Now, which is a restaurant frequented by college students simply for it's low prices-highly recommended.  About a half and hour to an hour later, my two friends and I were sitting on the couch, and all simultaneously burst out into laughter.

We sat there laughing for about 20 minutes, about nothing.  We then went to our neighbors room and borrowed his strobe light.  We turned it on high, turned on number 6 from the Mortal Kombat soundtrack (i know, it sounds stupid, but when you hear the song you'll know why) Sitting there, smoking cigarettes, and listening to this intense music with the strobe light kicking was the single most mind-bending experience of the night....until we went outside.  The weather was incredible-it nearing the end of August.  We went on a walk to the local 7-11 to buy smokes because in a matter of hours we had all smoked a pack a piece.(like I say, smoking feels great) So on the way we went on a path that is now known as Disney Land, because of the vibrant colors on the trees and the lighting scheme.  It was unbelievable.  It is now our designated spot to visit when we trip.  All nature is good.  Frequent any woody area, or riverbank-type area, and you will be astounded by the things that you see.  They are things that you see everyday, but at the state that we were in, the most simple things seemed so complex and intricate.  We got our smokes, went back to the dorm, and it had seemed like we were only gone for 15 minutes, when in reality we were gone for about an hour.  

We stood outside playing hackysack for about 3 hours, and then went back upstairs where we listened to music, drew pictures, and smoked.  All in all, it was a very pleasant experience, and to all those that have the means, I say go for it.  It is all natural, I've heard VERY few bad stories about it, and the memories you have from it are unforgettable.  Some say it is life changing.  I just regard it as a great time, provided by mother nature.  So good luck, and happy shrooming. P.S. remember to have some kind budz on hand to burn soon after shroom consumption-it helps them kick in, or at least for us it helped.  peace.







It was the summer before gr 11 and i had just gotten my own car.  It was time for a road trip.  Me and 5 other friends went to peach fest (an annual festival in penticton, bc, canada).  Peach Fest involved 10,000 young people going camping (or hoteling for the weaker)to a small town of interior BC and losing all inhibitions.  Nothing was planned except for tents, sleeping bags, a little food and some water.  

Before leaving one of my friends said he had some mushrooms to sell to me for $20.  He had had an incident a few months back on them that had him fighting a couple of friends, breaking down and crying like a little baby, and vowing to never eat mushrooms again.  I had smoked quite a bit of pot in my day, but mushrooms was something i'd always thought about trying and never did.  So I bought for $20 roughy 8 grams of muschrooms, one half of which had been crushed to powder sometime during that night he spoke of.  

We arrived in Penticton a little later than expected and luckily found a place to camp on the front lawn of a campsite owner.  After setting up the tent it was already 8 at night and it was time for something to be happening.  So i popped 7 grams of the mushrooms with some beer and waited for the effects.  Mushrooms were a foreign idea to me at the time.  7 grams didn't mean anything.  My friends who had some experience but very little didn't tell me anything about them or how much to take.  They thought i'd just aten a small palmfull.  I knew they made you hallucinate a bit, but that was all.  With some rum and daquiri mix (without ice and don't ask me why we were drinking it)  we headed to the strip of downtown penticton.  The mushrooms had begun to take effect.

My stomach had been bothering me for about a half hour.  I thought it was just the terrible alchohalic mix i was drinking.  The first thing that hit me was confusion.  Where are we going? What are we doing? Why can't i find anything in my pockets?  I soon became very aware of the awkward materiel of the clothes that i was wearing.  What the hell is this shirt made of?  By the time we'd hit downtown (acually clock time had lost all meaning to me by now so i couldn't say exactly how long it was till i started peaking) i was beginning to peak.  

We all had our own seperate missions to complete before the night could get going.  I myself was already on my mission.  Finding out what was really happening to me.  I followed one friend while the other 3 split to get more beer.  I would later find out that splitting up wasn't a really good idea. I lost my friend within minutes.  A family coming out of a restaraunt asked me the time.  I must have looked like a psychopath when i looked up at them, and tried to figure out who they were and how did i know them?  Of course i'd never seen them before, but in this state i almost couldn't recognize myself.  So i just blurted out some inchorent statement about nothing, laughed, and continued on my way.  The pavement was no longer pavement, but a patterns on top of patterns of dead leaves sand and rocks.  
Suddenly i could hear the friend that i'd lost yelling for me.  So i started to yell for him because i couldn't for the life of me figure out what direction the yelling was coming from.  Later i learned that was becuase there was noone trying to call me.  Across the street something caught my eye that abruptly stopped my yelling.  A vided mural on the wall that was attemting to brithgten up the town was moving.  The technicolor trumpet player stepped away from the wall a bit and his trumpet was now pointed toward me.  Little people or something vaguely representing them in multicolors were flowing from the wall and crawling into the end of this mans trumpet.  I knew i was on mushrooms, but couldn't believe that it was just the drugs causing this surreal momment.  

Luckily for me my friend came by an unknown amount of time later and shook me.  I turned at him and asked him why he couldn't see what i was seeing and then he asked me how much of the bag i'd eaten.  I told him and he let me in on the fact that i'd eaten quite a lot compared to the norm and that was why i was hallucinating so much.  Then i asked him 'didn't we just have this conversation'.  I learned then too the de ja vu effect was also from the mushrooms and that we hadn't.  I would experience this several times before the end of the night.  

I soon lost my friend again and forgot where i was supposed to meet him and everyone else and at what time.  I soon found myself in what i thought was a graveyard (again don't ask me why) and fell down.  The sky had turned on me.  The clouds were forming words and scentences that i couldn't read against the starlit night sky.  Who was trying to speak to me, and what are they trying to say?  Then the biggest trip of all happened.

One of the friends i went on  the trip with was a little person.  Wicked guy but you can never understand shit from him when he gets drunk.  So here i was lying on the gound and my midget friend steps over me and starts babbling about what i thought was a prophecy.  i started yelling, but soon calmed myself and tried to understand what the hell was happening.  It turned out i was lying on the front lawn of the town police station and had been laughing quite loudly for sometime with nobody around me.  

My bud lead me around the back of the cop station where some friends were drinking beer on a park bench.  I was sure the gig was up.  Cops had camera's on us and had just been collecting information.  Any minute swat teams were going to swing down from the trees.  Thankfully i was with a bunch of drunk but relativly sane people who set me straight.  All the police officers were out patrolling due to the usual problems they have with this festival every year.  

We headed to the beach and soon we were surrounded by people, most of them drunk and having a good time.  Myself on the other hand was having a hard time trying to figure out who's face it was on this giant peach.  It was actually a giant orange (those stands that serve drinks that was all closed up)  and it looked like it had a face that was raising it's eyebrow at me.  The sudden huge numbers of people was suprisingly not that hard to deal with, most likely because i knew somehow that they were all fucked and wouldn't notice me tripping in my own little world.  

The next few hours would be countless hallucinations and distortions that i kept having to clarify with my companions to make sure they weren't real.  It was definatly a night i will never forget.  Since i have tried many other varieties of mush rooms (in smaller dosages but still enough) although i still don't know what kind it was i did this paticular night.  I have also learned to research new drugs a little before doing them alhtough i must admit not knowing whats coming to you is a whole other trip. 
peace all







Recently, I got notice from a friend that there were shrooms available that night.  I had been meaning to try them, having tried acid, DXM, ecstasy, and marijuana.  My friend went to pick them up and we each had one sixteenth of an ounce at about 1:00am.  Afterwards, however, we got in a huge argument and my friend walked to a party leaving me to trip by myself.  Thus, my trip started off on the wrong foot and I was in a terrible mood when I began to feel the effects.  Eventually, I believe that this caused the peak of the trip to be more confusing and frustrating.  

The body buzz began setting in approximately 20 minutes after I ate the shrooms which, by the way, tasted nasty.  This buzz intensified for about another 45 minutes until it had become by far the most intense body buzz I had ever felt from any drug.  At this point, I was sitting with a friend in his room.  As I got more and more fucked, communication became harder and harder.  At the same time, other people came into my friend's room and everyone had a conversation which I was unable to comprehend let alone participate in.  This didn't stop me from trying.  Thus, for about two hours I wondered from room to room talking jibberish to my friends.  They were, of course, understanding but the experience was very confusing and frustrating for me as I realized that I was making no sense.  Even I was surprised by some of the random things that came out of my mouth.  Nonetheless, I couldn't stop talking.  

Meanwhile, I had begun to hallucinate for the first time on any drug.  While I can't qualify what these hallucinations were, my room was amazing.  It was decked out in psychedelic lights and pictures and everything was jumping out at me.  The walls moved and the world was tinted in different colors.  This was exciting, needless to say, and if I had relaxed by myself in my room, I'm sure the experience would've been much more enjoyable.  Finally, as I began to come down at around 4 am, I redeveloped my communication skills and talked for hours with my friends.  Aside from while I was on ecstasy, this was probably one of the most enjoyable conversations I had ever had.  However, in the last stages of coming down, I was very tired yet I knew I was unable to sleep yet.  Additionally, my stomach and throat felt wierd and I had a headache.  The same thing had happened to me on acid so I didn't sweat it.  Finally, at 9am, I was able to fall asleep for a few hours before I got up at noon for class.  Although this experience had ups and downs, I'm glad that I took the shrooms, and I learned a lot about how to take psychadelic drugs.  First of all, I learned tripping alone is not a good idea.  It's important, especially the first time on any drug, to take it with someone and to have someone sober to look after you.  I had plenty of friends with me to make sure I did nothing stupid, however, the experience would have been much more enjoyable had someone else been feeling what I was feeling.  Secondly, its always best to be in the right frame of mind prior to your trip.  I feel that this decreases the chances of having a bad time.  All in all, I am definately planning on shrooming again, although hopefully in a better setting and under better circumstances.







I had been tripping for some time, I fell in love with it. I felt as if I were in a fantasy land, and anything I dreamt of was possible. That night me and my best friend decided to trip and walk around the apartment complex. We both took two hits around 8:30. She weighs in at 105 pounds, me 125. Both of our experiences were totally different. Hers was good, mine a living hell.

We decided to smoke some weed, because it always enhanced our trip. After a couple of bowls of Hydro, I decided to get something to drink. As I got up, I saw everything distorted, words did not makes sense, and I lost myself in my brain and the drug completely. I called out to my friend, and said 'I'm  going to die'. She took me for a walk, and I saw colors and with every step I took, I sunk farther in the ground. I looked at my friend, and she had no body, just a huge face. A car was coming straight at me, and I just stared, she had to pull me out of the way.

She took me to her house, and tried to calm me down. As I sat on the carpeted floor, my bones were seeping through my skin, I felt knives stabbing at me, and felt the pain. I literally went crazy. The words didn't come out,the pictures i saw were flashes of the devil, angels, clouds, knives ... all I could think of. My body felt like jello, then rock hard. I eventually came off of it around 8:00a.m in the morning. Till this day, I have permanent trails, and lights seem like stars. In the pitch black, I still see colors, and when I think of an object, I can see it. It has been 3yrs since I tripped, and I feel the effects til this day.









My wife & I had been married 18 months. This was our first year experimenting with MDMA/E, after our first 20 sessions we decided to slow down. We went on holiday for two weeks, chilled out and returned refreshed. A big change in our lives occurred when we returned from our holiday, we moved to the other end of the country, away from all our friends and the places where we had grown up. 

The move was a very positive one, we settled in quickly and felt that since we knew almost nobody this would give us plenty of time alone. Pretty soon we began to require a nudge back to our spiritual path; for us the usage of psychoactives is a very spiritual experience.

We located a source from where to purchase our substances and one Friday night we settled down to undertake our first journey in some 3 months.

After approximately an hour, we were both pretty high, we then realised that we had run out of chewing gum; what followed next was to change my perception of so called reality for ever. We walked to the local shop, purchased our chewing gum without anything significant to report, then on the return journey back home, we were walking through the local park, when I was confronted by a vision, a simple vision, a man sat behind a desk in an office. It could have been anyone in a million people. Reasons, theories and explanations flooded my mind, why was this man here appearing to me? I wondered. 

We walked on and more people appeared to me, the trees were speaking and the earth was communicating, I felt alive in the most wonderful sense; I was at one with the Otherworld of the spirits and at one with the Earth.

Realisation smashed my face, I understood the visions, the communications; I knew why I was witnessing these wonders. I had transcended the constraints imposed by thousands of years of dominator culture on my brain and was able to access the most basic of all human functions, spirituality. These people who appeared to me were simply people functioning, their thoughts were embedded in the space that I was walking through, and I could access this simply through letting go. I had not realised that I had 'let go' but I had.

I relayed this information to my wife, she seemed pleased that I had received affirmation of my faith in my beliefs. She then informed me that I had been conversing with someone other than her whilst we were stood in the silence of the early morning air. Who it was I have yet to find out, but I now know that I can access the sane part of my brain, that anybody can. I now have to learn to control it.

Thanks for listening.







I went away from my job in Pittsburgh for the weekend of July 4th.  I met up with some travelers at the Pittsburgh Intern'tl Airport and we drove up to Ridgeway Pa in a rental car.  I was there for the weekend, and while camping down in the Bear Creek valley I heard that somebody was throwing a rave up in the main 'Owl's Nest' parking lot.  I chose not to go.  The night of July 4th I was walking with a good friend i hadn't seen in a long time.  He had been a soldier for the US army until he got kicked out for smoking pot.  

Anyway, he convinced me to go up to the rave that night in the parking lot.  He and I walked up to the A-camp that was nearby to get a ride to the main parking lot about 2 miles away.  I bought 2 hits for blotter from an older hipped out brother and gave one to my friend.  We were speculating about the authenticity of the stuff i'd just bought when some dude and his passenger asked us if we wanted a ride. We hopped right in and drove off for the parking lot where the rave was.  

We were crusing along with some strangers who were probably already tripped out, and here there was some other guy walking along the road.  The driver stopped and asked the guy if he wanted a ride.  So this other dude with a bookbag gets in the back seat with us.  He was rather 'studious' looking.  He was wearing glasses and had a button down shirt with a collar.  After we had went along a bit he asked the driver if he wanted any 'dose'.  The driver and his passenger declined.  My friend Hayden and i looked at each other and i then asked if we could have some.

This dude pulls out a chemistry lab storage bottle with a dropper at the top of it.  This bottle was brown glass and probably about 1000mL.  He says 'This is the washout from the basins that they use to make LSD.  Some elders gave it to me and told me to pass it on.'  

My friend and i thinking it was diluted each took about 2 droppers full of the liquid.  I distinctly remember swishing the liquid around in my mouth. 
Ahhhhhh.

So hayden and i were dropped off at the parking lot, and i began to feel the effects of the L starting to kick in.  We found out that we had quite a way to go to get to the party.    Hayden walked off and i sat down beside someone's dark green Vw bus.  I enjoyed laying there and i felt it's personality communing with me.  

I got up and went to walk down the road to the rave.  The effests were coming on strong now.  A group was a little bit ahead of me and someone had some glowsticks on a string spinning them around.  I kept thinking that they had lightsabers.  I caught up to the group, and i could hear a girl breathing across the road from me.  I moved closer to her. I felt that i needed to protect her.  I was her bodyguard.  I had no idea who she was.  I asked her name and she told me it was Amy.  

We walked further down the road.  Where was Hayden?  The moon was full, the silver light casting everything in a spacey glow. What a wonderful time i was going to have!!

I was a little scared form time to time, but the fear faded quickly.  The thing i was most concerned about was becoming confused and disoriented.

The group i was walking with finally got to the rave.  There at the entrance to the litle space off the road was Hayden.  I hugged him and he laughed.  He kept poking me to see if i was really there.  He said something to me about being naked, so i walked over behind the setup.  There was a u-haul and a gasoline generator with a tent canopy set up for the DJ booth.  I walked behind there and took off my clothes.  That's when the thoughts invaded.

Hayden had been in the Army.  He had been in communications. He had somehow taken contol of a government communications satelite. Here he was playing techno music on the world communication network!!!  He was the DJ!!!  I was running around naked yelling at the people over at the DJ booth to leave him alone.  

Then i thought that I was in the making of the next Star Wars... Episode II.  Frank Oz the voice of Yoda had died, and i was the only one who could talk like Yoda. I was running around talking like Yoda.  I thought my friends Laurie and Melissa were there.  I remember talking to a girl who i thought was Laurie.  That's when the corporations too over.

Since hayden had stolen the satelite, the top companies of the world wanted to restore peace.  An asian girl sat near me and mentioned somethign about Ford.  She was the daughter of the top Ford exec!!!  For some reason she got mad and went to walk away.  I tried to get her to stay there.  So i followed her to the entrance.  And there was Hayden!

He talked to me for a little bit and i asked him to help me find my clothes.  after a while he looked down at me and exclaimed 'You don't have any clothes!!!'  'I know!!! Help me find them, they're lost!!!!'

I did find my shoes, and i walked back out to the dirt roadway.  I was looking at the moon, and i kept seeing a laser beam shoot across my vision ala Dark Side of the Moon.  So i walked off in the direstion i thought leaded back to the main parking lot.  I was walking over near the edge of the road, and i entered the woods.  I was feeling kinda funny.  I stumbled into the brush, and i remember crashing over and falling down.  I was dying.

My mind drifted off into a Tolkien book.  I could see the words written in that elegant text.  I was part of the earth and my body melted (rotted?) away and for a thousand years i was a hillside.  Then water and wind pushed away the dirt and i was flat again.  It was like i was reliving that part of the earth's memory.  

I became concious lying on my back staring up at the stars through the canopy of leaves.  I had the feeling i was lying in a net.  Some people were talking to me.  This was a test.  I was being trained for the special underground organization that Hayden belonged to.  I was held in a net and i felt my mind drift away.  I became a two dimensional object.  I was a 'downward spiral'.  I was spinning and spinning and drifting downwards.  Images came to my mind of two seperate entities.  A goat an a dove were pulling in opposite directions.  I had a message sent into my brain.  
'There is no greater wrong than a child torn between the parents of two different religions'

I spiraled off some more and i became the film of oil on a stagnant stream, and i looked up to see a dragonfly land above me.  It's compound eye glittered in the sunlight.  I then became one of the facets of the eye.  The words of Albert Einstein entered my mind.  'I just want to know the thoughts of God. Everything else is just details.'  I saw Einstein as he arrived in heaven. He asked God what the answer to life was, and God said 'YES'.  As i became coherent i thought that God had let me travel back through time and space.  I had been allowed to go back to 1978.  I was allowed to travel to San fransisco, California in that year.

I got up and broke free from my 'net'.  As I walked out of the woods i thought i could surf.  I ran down the road as fast as i could, and i stopped a guy standing beside the road.  'What year is it?'  He looked at me kinda funny and answered '1999, dude'

So i tried to find my clotes again, but no dice.  At least i had my shoes.  Now, if i could only find which way i was supposed to go.  I walked for a bit and ran into a 'DEP' officer.  I walked over to him and asked him how to get to get to the parking lot. He issued me a ticket.  I didn't have any pockets, so i slipped it in the window of a parked car along the road.  I kept walking, and if i saw a car approach, i would hide in the woods.  I stopped by another car along the road, and i asked a guy that was camping there  for a pair of pants i could wear.  He hooked me up with some pajamas pants.

I finally made it to the parking lot after an eternity of walking.  I had lost Hayden, but i knew i'd see him again. I went over to the rental car i had come up in, and layed on the back window.  I looked up at the stars, and i saw the milky way smeared across the darkness. I fell asleep glad to be out of the whole mess.  Someone nearby was playing some Grateful Dead on a car stereo, and i fell asleep to Jerry's guitar.  

I woke up a little later and i was freezing.  I got up and walked around.  Two cars over someone had left their window down.  I looked inside and decided that they wouldn't mind if i slept for a little bit inside.  I opened the door and crashed out again on their back seat.  

When i woke up in the morning, i rolled up the window of the car and walked down to the valley to meet my traveling companions.

What a trip!







I had been out of pot for several days and didn't have anyway of getting more in the near future. So I started brainstorming to figure out a substitute. Fortunately, I had some morning glory seeds which I had set aside for a rainy day. Remembering this, I immediately found them and began crushing them up with a hammer. This was difficult to do since they kept scattering everywhere. I gave up on this and just decided to eat them. On several previous occasion, I had tried morning glory seeds, but the only effects I experienced were some nausea and inexplicable flashes of light. Overall, nothing much happened. For that reason, I didn't expect much from this experience.

I went to our kitchen and made some of that oatmeal with strawberries in it. Then I took the partially mashed up seeds and mixed them in. Previous attempts had left me with a very strong aversion to the taste of the seeds, so I needed the oatmeal to mask it. I ate all of it, but I did not feel any nausea. I didn't really feel much of anything. But then I noticed that I started to feel somewhat light and feathery. That is the only way I can explain it. Then I would think about it and decide that it was just a placebo effect. I would then decide that was untrue and say that it was the seeds. This went on for about 20 minutes.

This was kind of boring, so I decided to drive around. I began to feel sort of disoriented, almost like being drunk. This, I decided, was a sign that I should stop driving around, so I stopped by a friend's house. By this time, I was feeling kind of sick and anxious. I was pretty disappointed because I wasn't experiencing anything even close to being psychedelic. When I tried to think, it felt like I had to put forth considerable effort in doing so. It just made me feel like my brain had been numbed and, for that reason, I couldn't use it to think. It turned out that my friend had some pot, so we smoked a few bowls. This made me feel much better, but there were still no psychedelic effects. And that was the way it would be for the rest of the night. No psychedelia. What a disappointment. And I really don't think it would be worth my time to try them again.












I felt nothing, went to sleep, woke up, puked and shit at the same time. did it on and off for hours. I went to the hospital. I got sent home they gave me potassium and a green pepto bismal like stuff. I suffered and suffered and puked more. I had such intense pain in my liver mostly. I had to go back they finally gave me a shot of demerol that helped for a while and I persciption for darvaset. I stayed the night in the hospital finally falling asleep. I still had severe liver pain for two or three days after. I couldn't feel a high besides a little stimulation. I took milk thistle seed extract the night of ingestion, and I think tylenol. I might of had kava kava earlier that day or the day before. I learned  a lesson not to do that again. I don't have any idea what this other report's talking about. I thought I read after it was used as dart poison or something.








To all you people who say that Jimson Weed is stupid and that no one should try it...

Personally, I like jimson weed. It's cheap (about 10 bucks a pound) and it CAN get you really screwed up. What I like about jimson weed is that when you make tea from it, you can easily control your high/trip. Just bring about 1 1/2 cups of water to a boil, turn heat down, throw in about 3 or 4 good sized pinches of jimson with a tea bag, then let simmer for about 15 minutes. The water should turn a brownish color. Strain mixture into a glass and drink up :) If you're wondering how much to drink then read on. If the tea is a light brown and you can see the bottom of the glass, then one glass will make you feel a little bit high and a little bit drunk. If you cannot see the bottom of the glass, then about 1/4 of it will give you the effects just described. 1/2 of a glass will make you feel even more drunk, and a full glass of the strong stuff will make you start to trip a LITTLE bit, about the same effect as taking 1 hit of pretty good acid. If you drink more, all I can say is BE CAREFUL! When you're really screwed up off jimson, you will feel very drunk and fall down a lot (but you dont puke(!)), you smoke imaginary joints and cigarettes and still get high from the imaginary joint. Anything you pick up won't be in your hands much longer :) All the stuff I just described is if you drink a lot or if you make REALLY strong tea. The tea will taste kinda gross. If you're wondering about one of my experiences then read on.. :)

I boiled about 1 cup of water and put about 5 big pinches of jimson in the water. The tea was VERY dark and tasted very gross, but I wanted to get fucked up and I did..

At first I didn't feel it and was complaining (it seems that everyone who says they don't feel it gets the most fucked up.) Well, about 30 minutes later I couldn't stand up. I sat down and almost fell out of the chair. My friend passed me a joint and I took it into the kitchen, dropped it, then went and sat on the couch and started smoking an imaginary joint. I kept trying to pass it, wondering why no one would take it. Then my friend said 'wanna hit this?' as he passed me the bong. I smacked it out of his hands. After he filled it back up with water he passed it to me again and I tried to take a drink out of it. Thank god he didn't let me, cause I would've chugged it. I probably dropped about 5 beers all together and smoked at least 3 imaginary cigarettes. Theres a lot more that happened but those were the parts I remember the most. I do have a friend who drank 2 glasses of the strong shit and was making drug deals with the toilet. So I don't advise drinking more than 1 glass! :)

Hope this gave you a better understanding of jimson weed.









This was my first time trying nutmeg, i heard about it on the web and thought, what the hell.  So i went to the supermarket and bought a nice sized box of whole nutmeg.

Hour 1:  Took entire tablespoon at 1 p.m., very hard stuff, hope it's worth it. Around 2 p.m. started feeling very stoned (but without the red eye and dry mouth!)

Hour 2-4: feeling VERY stoned.  sat and chilled out for a while.  very light, calm hallucinations beginning.

Hour 4-6:  pretty nice closed eye visuals going on, very focused daydreams when i try.

Hour 6-8:  stoned feeling starting to subside, oh well.  More closed eye visuals going on. At first i thought these may be acid flashbacks, but they are too unlike an LSD state of mind.

Basically, the effects of hour 6-8 carried on until i went to bed.  I woke up the next morning with a very pleasant buzz still going.  Plus, i don't think i've had a better night's sleep.  All in all the nutmeg was worth it.  Not something i would do on a regular basis, but maybe just a lazy summer day experiment to try again.  With proper music and state of mind, the nutmeg can be fun.







I had done Ecstasy for the first time 3 days prior to this one.  I was in Mexico on my senior trip ,and having the time of my life.  I had done E the first time at a foam party, so I thought that couldn't be beat.  Well I was wrong.

I had met this girl at the beginning of the week and was totally liking her.  It was my last day together with her so I wanted her to try X out.  She agreed and so I gave her a pill and told her that I would meet her later on that night.  When my friends and I got to the club we were rollin pretty hard andI really wanted to find her and see how she was.  When I finally found her she told me she was feeling pretty good, but I knew it really had not hit her yet.  We went and sat down on some couches and started to talk, about 5 min. into the conversation she told me she wasn't feeling well.  I calmed her down and told her to relax, I also reassured her that it was normal, and the drug was coming on.  She went to the bathroom and tried to throw up (I had one of my girlfriends in there with her), but she didn't and about 5min. later she came out and told me she wanted to sit down.  So I sat there kind of disappointed until this certain song came on.  It must of triggered her b/c right when it came on she looked at me with a big smile, and told me how good she was feeling now.  I was so happy about this.  I gave her a menthol cigarette (a must) and told her to dance for me.  She got up right in front of me and gave me a great, sexy dance.  Right then I started falling in love with her.  After a while we decided to go back to the hotel.  We went back and took some more (I took a h-bomb and I gave her a half of one).  We stared mesing around and eventully had sex.  Let me tell you it was the most intense sex ever.  The second pill hit me hard during this time and I was feeling numb.  Afterwards I decided to take a hot shower (let me tell you this was probably the best feeling I had ever had).  We then walked to the beach and layed in a lounge chair looking at the stars and listening to the waves crash.  I was now totally convinced I was in love.  We opened up to each other that night telling one another how we felt and how we hoped this feeling would never end.

Well I left a few hours lated, very sad, yet happy at the same time.  We saw each other again and it was awsome, we both still felt the same way.  However now it's all messed up.  We go to different colleges and haven't seen each other for a long time.  We still talk sometimes, but don't know what to do.  This is where E can cause confusion.  However I still wouldn't trade that night for anything!








My roommate had the habit of collecting strange herbs for her 'rituals', and one day she suggested I mix wormwood with alcohol to make absinthe. I thought that was a wonderful suggestion, so I mixed a healthy portion of these dry wormwood clippings in a tiny airliner of Bacardi Limon. I let this witches brew sit in my window sill for almost three weeks, and at that point the fliud had turned completely green. I decided it was time to try this drug to see what all the hype was about. My roomate had explained that people from America's past had raved about this drug up until it was outlawed, so I decided the trip must be somewhat enjoyable. However I was wrong. This stuff tassted like LIQUID DOG SHIT! I could barely drink the little 2 oz. bottle without gagging uncontrollably. I think I copped a buz, but I cannot be sure if it was an absinthe buzz or an alcohol with shitty tasting herbs buzz. I would not try this stuff again, unless someone made a sweet tasting wine out of it (supposedly that is absinthe's original form).









When I was a more experimental youth I usd to get high off cough syrup, but I stopped after the fifth trip, the trip described in the following report. It was the highest I have ever been in my life. 

My friend G and I were hiking through Tilden on an effort to get high. We had only the shakiest of the schwag, so we had to look to other options if we wanted to cop a decent buzz. I happened to choose cough syrup, while G chose budweiser. The form I took the DXM in was easier to swallow than syrup: these little red pills called Drixoral Cough Pills or something like that, each containing about 50 -100mg of DXM. I chased about a dozen of these little suckers with budweiser, which my stomach quickly expelled, but not before I had absorbed a fair amount of the drug.

Before I came up completely my friend had decided we leave the wilderness (I recall laying down and complaining of sleepiness) and travel to our buddy M's house. Along the way I lost my stomach, but this made me feel alot better. By the time we got to my friends house, the initial confusion of the trip was giving way to true psychedelic experience.

Before I had felt extremmely dizzy and tired, but after puking the dizziness left me feeling light headed and somehow disconnected from my body. Walking felt more like swimming, and images of rooms and people flowed past me as if i were stationary. Soon my visual field broke down completely. This lasted for an infinite stretch of time. My friends tell me I sat in a chair without really moving for hours on end, staring at blank space without aknowledging anyone or even accepting a joint as it was handed to me (I do remember accepting a hit one, right before my catatonia hit ...).

What I experienced was the most amazing visual hallucination I can recall. My minds eye was completely open, and I thought I could view all angles at once. The best analogy would be that normal vision is a 20 inch television, but the mind's eye on DXM is an Imax theater. The boundaries of my vision were gone, and I could focus on everything simultaneously. The lands I visited were infinite and varied, but I forgot most the details. One world was an outer space landscape filled with creatures and objects that were constantly in states of trasmutation. I stayed here fir what felt like eons, before the vision gave way to a Dante's Inferno-esque landscape. The ground was rocky and barren, but the horizon was a sheet of pure hellfire. Within the flames burned the images of the band Metallica (in the real world my friends were blasting 'and Justice'). 

I believe that my spirit had left my body during these experiences, and I actually adventure within some of the realms that exist between the perceptual universe. This experience was incredably exhilirating, and I believe that with further trips soem tangible wisdom can be gained therein. However the drug method of spiritual travel left my body fatigued and my mind weary. My spirit eventually took back my physical body, at which point my eyes snapped open. Of this world I saw only two enormously wrinkled snakes, made out of cotton. They were floating in front of me, then on top of me, then they landed at my waist and formed my legs. I realized that now I could walk, and in an effort to prove it I promptly fell out of the chair that had housed my body while my mind flew between worlds. My friends looked up at me as startled as you might expect an embalmer to feel as if his cleint's rose from their slabs suddenly. It was the first indication of intelligent life I had made in  hours, and I lay strewn across the rug like a bearskin rug. To make a long story short, some beer and pot greatly improved my condition, and in no time I was blathering about my experience to a deaf audience. They had never heard of cough syrup trips, and I think that after my experience, they will never try it themselves. Too bad for them; James Hetfield plays incredibly well as a fifty foot wall of flame.






 [Erowid Note: 
Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe recreational use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.] 

Me and a few friends are big fans of trichloroethane, but it got banned as a cfc and powerful carcinogen. Now instead of 'try'cloroethane (which always had all the bells and whistles of tactile visual/mental/physical sensations) we have found a replacement.  Tetrachloroethylene, which has for me better bells and whistles than 1-1-1 trichloro.  

Because I am well aware that it's a powerful carcinogen I take a few anti-oxident multivitamins as well as a few caps of Coenzyme-Q-10,which is also called ubiquinone; hopefully that will delay cancer, but anyone who huffs should look foreward to it sooner or later anyway. Great bells&whistles though-good luck.








I never even dreamed that a feeling like this was humanly possible.  Every aspect of my life seemed to collide and piece togther too perfectly, I am still amazed 10 months following my first gamble with ecstasy.  It was my 20th birthday and my best friend in the whole world was about to leave for medical school in India.  She drove 12 hours to see me for my birthday.  I gathered her, along with my 6 closest friends, and my boyfriend to a club in NYC.  I was having problems with my boyfriend at the time, and I wasn't even sure if we'd be togther very long. I thought this was going to be the end of many relationships that night.  I swallowed my pill, along with my best friend.  We got on the subway, and all of us were on our way to the club.  As we headed down to the city, I suddenly felt something in my mouth.  It was the most disgustingly sour taste I ever felt.  I wanted to puke!  I told my friend, and she said don't worry.  That didn't help much because a few minutes later, I started noticing that blood was dripping from the ceiling.  I then noticed everyone on the subway staring at me, while blood was dripping from their mouths.  It was so SCARY.  I turned to my boyfriend and told him what I was seeing.  He quickly tried to console me as I was still bugging out.

Eventually a few minutes later, a huge smile came across my face, and everything was all sunny, even in the depths of the subway.  Everyone seemed happier with me.  The blood disappeared and my boyfriend was the greatest guy in the world. We switched trains, and I told everyone about that horrible expiernce I had on the other train.  I sat on my boyfriend's lap, and he was the most clever, interesting, and sweet guy in the world.  I started to propose to him!  I was so IN LOVE with him, I wanted to die. As a matter of fact, I was starting to hyperventilate because I couldn't even tell him how in love I was with him.

We eventually made it to the line at the club.  I was the best-dressed girl there, and was with the most charming man.  I felt like Cinderella.  I got in the club and was dancing to the most hypnotic sounds.  I must have danced for 3 hours.  I then sat on a couch and fell asleep, feeling the effects of the ecstacy wear off.  I felt like my dream was over.  We walked home and I began to see that everything was okay.  My best friend was going to still be my best friend, and my boyfriend is going to be there for me.  I was able to put things in perspective and see life in such a different way.







A friend of mine had been using E on a regular basis for quite some time.  I'd heard various stories and naturally, I was curious.  My friend suggested that I do some research on the topic, which led me to this and other sites discussing the effects of E.  After a considerable amount of reading, I decided to give it a try.  What an experience!  I'm so glad I did.

We had tickets for 'The Big Day Out' (a major event held in Sydney and New Zealand each year, featuring a whole load of new bands, really good!).  Anyway, my friend decided that because there'd be so much to experience as far as sound & vision was concerned, that this would be the perfect place for my introduction into the wonderful world of E.

We'd planned it very carefully, timing etc. Took half a 'dino' at 8.30am.  I felt a little strange, nothing drastic though.  Had a few cones.  

At around 12.30 I took the other half, sat down for a while.  Got up to move and WHOAAAAA!!!!!  Suddenly everything seemed to be in incredibly sharp focus.  I could pick out conversations over the crowd noise that I wouldn't normally notice.  I kept wandering off in every direction, forgetting what it was that I was doing in the first place when I got half way to wherever it was that I was going!!  Strangely, I didn't care!  And the music!  Wow!!  I was hearing things I'd never noticed before!  It was hypnotic!  All I could do was stand there, head back, eyes closed, letting the music flow in, out, around & through me.  Listening to the Nine Inch Nails do 'Closer' was the closest I've ever gotten to having a religious experience!!! 

I went on a couple of amusement park rides, couldn't stop laughing, I was so fascinated with the lights, the music on the ride, the people whizzing past, (it was the hurricane we were on, a fairly fast ride).  My balance was shot to pieces by the time I got off the ride, again...I just didn't seem to care!

It was a fairly hot day, so I drank ALOT of water, I'm sure I must've drunk around 5 litres.  My friend was insisting that I buy a bottle of water every half an hour, wether I thought I needed it or not.  He did a very good job of looking after me that day, making sure I didn't wander off and get lost in the crowd, (there were 64,000 people there so it wouldn't have been hard to get lost).

We had a few more cones during the day, which seemed to enhance the effect of E...who knows..maybe it was just my imagination?  We chilled for a while, got into some deep and meaningful conversation about life, the universe and everything.  My friend and I found out some things about each other that both amazed and amused us.  I suppose everybody does that though.  By this stage the day was getting on, it was around 8.00pm.  Time seemed to be disappearing in three to four hourly blocks!  The day flew, definately not long enough.  My friend decided that enough time had passed, my tolerance to E seemed to be nothing short of amazing for a first timer, so we decided to take yet another half tablet each just to finish the day off on a high note, so to speak.  

We were awake until 4.00am the next day, listening to trippy music, drinking endless cups of coffee and smoking cigarette after cigarette.  I LOVE to smoke on E, I found out (as thousands of other people would already know), that smoking is wonderful!  Especially menthol cigarettes!!   

Thanks to my friend I had a GREAT day, my introduction to E was a safe and glorious one.  Needless to say, I'm one of the converted!!!!







I recently tried smoking buddah.  What an experience it was.  The dosage was about 3 large bowls (by myself mind you).  I heard a lot about people smoking it and feeling great so I decided it was for me.  I lit up in the second floor of my garage where I have a small party room set up. I always heard that it worked fast, but for some reason I smoked all of it.  There was no reaction.  I was so disapointed because there was a school dance that night and I hoped to be stoned for it. So I thought what the hell I'll go have a couple of shots of vodka before I go that'll do the trick.  After about 30 minutes my mother called me in the house to eat.  I remember my mouth being extremely dry. While I was eating i went throught 5 glasses of soda.

About 15 minutes into dinner I felt this huge sense of relaxation and calm. Then when I lifted my fork to put some steak in my mouth.... BAM! I whipped the fork across the room and couldn't explain why.  At this point I was way out of my mind so I went to my room and downed about 10 or 11 shots of vodka.  My friend came to pick me up and couldn't believe how messed up I was.  He kept laughing at me and asking if I was ok.  I was like yeah whatever.  After about 1 and 1/2 hours after smoking up I felt another wave of the tinglies come over me.  Then when we were pulling into the school parking lot I was the happiest I had ever been.  I remember feeling so at peace with myself and everyone else around me.

I was looking at the street lights when all of a sudden the poles they were on began to bend over.  This seriously freaked me out as I had never heard of people hallucionating on weed before.  Then I looked to my friend to ask if he could see it and his face took on the form of a penguin.  I was seriously wacked out so i decided to make the best of it and just enjoy it. We were walking in when suddenly the school zoomed out away from us about 100 yards.  Then it zoomed in again about 2 minutes later.  So we went inside and it was about 2 hours from liftoff so I was definetely out there somewhere.  We got in on the dance floor and another peaceful wave hit me only this time it wouldn't recide.  It just got stronger, stronger, and stronger until it stayed there at the same level for about an hour or so.  All the while I saw patterns in things, not like out of nowhere like on acid or anything, but simply on tye-dye shirts or on the paint on the walls etc.  I would have spells where i would just stare at them and talk to them.  Then I got upset because a gnome I saw on a table wouldn't talk back to me (people must have been staring terribly).  So I decided to go outside for a minute and calm down.  Outside I discussed the dismemberment of the Grateful Dead with my friend (both of us being deadheads).  So after about 10 minutes or so I went back inside.  When I got on the dance floor, it just went on forever.  It was infinite, never ending, until I saw the DJ and he was at a point that looked like the edge of the plane.  I went up to where he was only to find it went on forever still. I was amazed.  It was like a revalation that went through my body.  I suddenly tied it to the possibilities of life being infinate and ever changing.

At the end of the dance I met up with my penguin headed friend and headed to the car.  I couldn't stop thinking about the plane, about how it just kept going.  So I got home about 12:00 and went directly to bed.  It took me 20 minutes to do it but i crawled into bed, turned on some Phish, and looked forward to my next experience.

I told some of my stoner friends about this and they believe that there was definetely something besides weed in the bag I had.  My one friend said Datura, another said PCP.  In any case all I can say is that Marijuana should be legalized because it can truly change you life for the better.











Myself and a friend of mine recently decided to experience Amanita muscaria, so we placed an order and both consumed around 10 grams each. Roughly an hour and a half later I began having a very pleasent mellow trip. It seemed more relaxed than any other hallucinogen I have ever done, because I was able to think and speak much more clearly than LSD which can sometimes overwhelm me and leave me speechless, but the Amanitas did not and I really enjoyed the trip until I decided to smoke some Salvia. I loaded a full bowl in my water bong and took two deep hits and held them in for awhile. About 5 seconds later my mind began racing out of control. The first thing that crossed my mind was this is never going to end, I stumbled to my quiet dark room to try and get control of my head, but as soon as I laid down my mind (and there's no other way to describe it) got caught in a loop of thought so all I could do was think about the same thing over and over again. My mind was caught in a loop and I thought I would be forced to think the same thing over and over again for the rest of my life. It took me into a whole other reality where I had no control of my body or mind. It was like being caught in a waking dream that basically caused me to go completely catatonic. Nobody could get through to me. This went down around 11:30Pm. My roomate went to bed about 1 AM and when he went to sleep I was sitting on the couch with a blank stare on my face lost in the recesses of my mind. 

When my roomate woke up around noon the next day I was sitting in the same place with my eyes wide open and still totally unreachable. The only reason I can relay this is because this is what I was told I have no memory from right after I took those two hits till about 6 Pm the following day. As I started coming around about 5pm the next day I truly start feeling terrified all over again because I was stuck in between two realities and I felt like I was moving through time differently than everybody else. I started coming out of the haze totally confused and oblivious to what the fuck happened for the last 20 hrs of my life. All I remember is thinking that I had figured out something very profound like a simple truth that would explain everything in life, but I could think of nothing else. It was hell folks. Eventually I tried to sleep but I would lay down and ten minutes would pass but it felt like I was away for hrs. At one point I came out of my room and asked my rommate how long I had been asleep (I thought it was the next day) he replied its been only ten minutes. So I decided to do what I should have done the night before but couldnt and thats pop some Xanax. Usually two footballs put me out but it took 8 of them to finally put me to sleep. As soon as the Zanax kicked in I started feeling normal again but I felt mentally shattered. I have no clue what caused this catastrophy, I felt like I was the brink of insanity when I was coming round, I realized my own mortality very quickly. The best explanation I can come up with and I would like help if anybody knows, is that the salvia was magnified by ten fold by the A. muscaria because very high doses of salvinorin A took people totally out of reality but for 20 hrs? and only two puffs of salvia. Whatever did it beware to all, nobody should have to go through that. If anybody knows why a bomb went off in my head when combining Salvia and Muscarias please reply in a post, this was the most profound and shitty experience of my life.







My friend decided to give me a dose of GHB the other day.  I have taken it before and slightly overdosed one other time.  This time however was quite different.  I took a little over a teaspoon and was feeling pretty good about 20 minutes later.  I felt happy, everything was great, nothing seemed wrong, and somewhat dizzy.  The walls kept moving on me...But at the time it seemed almost like a challenge to walk.

Anyways, about an hour and a half later I decided that I wanted to take more.  I took my friends bottle and poured more powder into my drink.  I didn't realize how much it was until I started feeling effects only 10 minutes later.  I realized then I took about 2-3 teaspoons on top of the other teaspoon I had consumed earlier.  10 minutes after taking my G, I felt rather dizzy and couldn't keep my head up very well.  I was also feeling rather tingly all over and I think someone could have probably punched me and I wouldn't have known.  Within 1/2 hour I was feeling incredibly awful and sick.  I felt as though I had to vomit and my mouth was watering way too much.

I insisted on driving to pick up my friend from school and on my way there started to vomit. I threw up only a couple of times.  I sat on the curb at Hardee's in the parking lot and continued to feel messed up.  I got back in the car after a few minutes of gathering myself together and continued to drive.  It was incredibly hard and do not recommend it to anyone.  I felt awful and after I picked my friend up I went back to my house and passed out for 3 hours.  When I woke up my stomache felt a little ill, but after being awake for 1/2 hour or so I felt fine.

[Erowid Note: Driving after a heavy dose of GHB is an incredibly dangerous and stupid thing to do.  Note that shortly after returning home this individual passed out.  Passing out while driving can kill you or someone else.  Please be safe and smart.]   







this is the first time i have rolled since October so it has been quite a few months and i was ready to be blown away once again by this wonderful drug. a bunch of friends and i were planning to take it, all at different times of the night, so that couples could have some alone time, and then we would all hang out together. i was going to wait until much later in the evening to take my pills, but then i realized that if i took it early i would have time to be alone and possibly write. i have always wanted to write while on ecstacy so i could go back and read it and see exactly what i was feeling. so, that is what i'm going to post here, what i learned and wrote down while rolling. but before i get into that, i just want to comment on the roll in general. i had 2 pills crushed and in a gel cap. i took the gel cap at around 8:40 with hot tea. by 8:55 my hands were getting tingly. i went downstairs to tell my housemate,  A., that i was starting to roll. when i went back upstairs to my room, it was like *@!POW!@*. i came up very fast and this lasted for approximately 2 hours (it was as i was coming up by myself that i wrote what i am going to post below). then i came down a notch, still rolling but on a plateau. and i've been coming down notch after notch. it's now 12:42 and i'm still getting warm rushes, euphoria from just deep breaths, and occasionally fluttering eyes. so anyhow, here's what i wrote down when i rolled (i hope it doesn't seem cracked out. i apologize if it is= ).

and i am there you and i and everyone one one together it's everywhere i am seething over flowing blossoming my entirety overcome with joy it has been so long oh how i have missed you yes embrace me on the inside yes that is what i feel and i feel not everyone can comprehend the way everything thing thing just fits together and is as it should be because i can think so lucidly you have no idea i am clear i am one my god my god i have missed you everything is one this pounding pounding bang bang music in my head it drives me i can feel it melting with my mind to touch these limbs that were so tired how could i could i could i forget all this as i do when everything is one and a key unlocks an ornately decorated glass box it's pink and black and blue and swirling and not glass but can change at will and the key opens and out it comes like magic on fire one one  reaching one gathering one collecting wills swirling into one so powerful i can hardly contain it like the top of my head just poof evaporated and at last the positivity was set free  let it touch you too my god let it touch you i think i wish i thought i felt my god my god i'm rising so far up let it touch you too like magic and secrets that you must come this way to understand. 

(btw, the my gods are not a religious thing. for all you rollers out there, i'm sure you know that saying 'oh my god' or 'i feel SO good' are two pretty good ways to describe what you're experiencing. that's what i usually find myself and others saying anyway.)









Last night, Thursday, 2/17/00, I decided to try Hawiian Baby Woodrose seeds to fulfill my curiosities.  At four PM on Wednesday I scraped (the dried fuzz on the seeds) eight HBWR seeds and roasted them for a few seconds over a candle (to make sure they were good and cleaned). Then using a very clean coffee grinder I ground the seeds into a coarse powder (the best I could get) and put them into some kool-aid. I let the mixture sit in the fridge covered for 24 hours.

On Thursday I made it a point to eat nothing at all, only a can of mountain dew for breakfast and water, cause I read that HBWR can make you nauseus. At a quarter to five I held my nose and chugged the concoction which didn't taste all to terrible. I then went to my best friend's house (who happens to live next door to me) to wait for the fun to begin. We popped in a DVD, pleasantville, at five. About half way into the movie (6:30) I started getting that kind of queasy headache feel, kinda like after downing a bottle of tussin, but not as intense, it was bearable and started to go away soon. I noticed an intense fascination with the movie almost as if I was fully a part of it, I realized I was intensely transfixed when my friend had to shake me to to respond to his question which I hadn't even heard. 

I have dosed on acid a few times and hit the dxm rush more times than I care to recall so all of this is going to be compared with acid or dxm. Also I will say right now this is not the same as acid it is rather more like a good dxm rush. 

When the movie ended around 7PM I was feeling great, body movement was an interesting procedure, when I got up to pee (which I found myself doing alot) it was as if I were moving in many different directions all at once. My friend (who was stone sober) suggested we take a walk so he could smoke some weed, I would have toked up too if I wasn't being tested, I proceeded to walk along with strange vigor. Unlike most drugs, HBWR does not change your perception of cold, which it was, it was frosty balls outside but I didn't mind. The closest thing I can compare it to was the peak of a dxm rush after smoking entirely too much weed, you know that warm fuzzy feeling in the back of your head right behind your eyes. It is about eight PM when we get back, I find myself fascinated with fire, which oddly enough didn't burn rather it just felt warm, real warm judging by the blisters on my fingers which just started hurting today, my friend was playing the piano while I sat gazing into the flame of a candle, feeling as if my body was falling into a pleasant warmth. 

An hour later I decided to go home and try to play some playstation, bad idea- it just messes with your head and gives you that naucis headache which didn't go away. 

About 10PM I started slowly coming down, I was still real fascinated with everything, I couldn't stop watching qvc for like a half hour. By this time I was pretty straight with only a mild buzz to keep me goin'. 

The whole experience was very similar to high doses of marijauna smoke coupled with the intense fascination and mellow mood one gets from a good clean dxm trip, not cough syrup but rather powder or pure dxm without ephedrine in it. 

My suggestion for dosing on HBWR is to go see something with friends like a movie or a show that you can sit and become entranced in. For the most part I was completely coherent (if my parents couldn't tell I was all jacked up no one could have) so I think it is a good drug to take before going out with friends or take it with friends, either way it's a fun time. I did however get a headache real bad about midnight, I think that might have been do to dehydration because HBWR makes you pee like mad, so the next time I do it (which will be for the rocky horror picture show next weekend) I will be sure to drink Plenty of water to keep hydrated. 

After some advil I was out like a light until I woke up at 10AM totally refreshed and feeling great, with no unpleasant hangover effects.

This has been the account of my experience I hope you use the information to have a safe and happy trip to a hawiian paradise.
  
P.S. I will write about the rocky horror picture show and tell you how it went.






I had wanted to do Ecstacy for a long time. So when my roommate scored some I was 'x'static. (Excuse the pun). We went to a house where we knew everyone was going to be rolling too (which I highly recommend). We dropped our pills at about 10:30. Luckily, we had a few bowls to keep our minds off the time. About 45 minutes later, I sat down and that's when it hit me. I didn't just gradually ease into my trip, I was thrust into it. All of a sudden my breath became really deep; I felt like I had to breath more often and more deeply. Most of the people there were really low key, but for some reason it effected me differently. I couldn't stay still. I was going though cabinets and jewelry. The most bizzare thing about the effects was it made my eyes wiggle. Let me make that a little clearer...my eyes would shake uncontrollably. After about an hour they settled down a little. I think that night I must have rolled for about 6 hours. Though, the first 3 were the most intense. 

About seven days after that my roommate and I decided to roll again but we practicually felt nothing. And we were told by friends that these were supposed to be really good pills. But they had no effect on us. That was a huge disappointment.

More than a month later we rolled again and it was a good experience but nothing like the first time. It also took about an hour and a half to effect me. And once again, my eyes went crazy and twitched a lot. 
I had always heard that the days following an Ecstacy experience you would feel depressed and uneasy. But with me it's exactly the opposite. I'm usually in a better mood than normal in the following days. 

And one more thing if you know your are going to roll a day or so in advance, try not to eat at least 6 or 7 hours before you drop the pill. That, I think, makes it work faster and seems to make it more potent.







A friend of mine gave me an eighth of an ounce for my birthday. After doing a lot of homework on advice (set and setting, etc.) I decided to split them with someone I trusted. This was my first time and, so far, my only shroom experience.

I did not experience anything unusual within the first hour or so, possibly even two hours. What I did notice (upon analyzing the events later on) was a slowly rising giddyness and an inability to hold a train of thought for very long. During the course of the walk from where my friend and I took them to my apartment I would forget a line of thought then it would bubble up maybe five, ten minutes later. The giddyness felt something like being drunk, only with hyper overtones.

The whole night I did not experience any visuals beyond some meager trails. But the mental aspect was...illuminating. Over the course of the next few hours I was to go through a seemingly unrelated series of emotional states, such as extreme confidence, paranoia, bewilderment (did I mention paranoia? more on that later). I ran into the friend who had given me the shrooms that night, after I'd parted ways with my shroom partner. (Newbies: it is not recommended to separate from your partner(s) at any time during the experience).

My provider expected me to be having vivid hallucinations and to be unable to separate hallucination from reality. Instead, my mind felt like it was in some kind of uncontrollable turbo mode. I found myself pacing around at one point. I think the calmest moments I had during the peak was, perhaps pathetically, while listening to Jimi Hendrix. You think that stuff is good when you're sober? It spoke to my soul in those moments. Then my provider distracted me and wanted me to see something cool. Another note: when somebody's trippin', just let them do whatever, as long as they're not endangering themselves or others, of course. It tends to disturb and already teetering emotional control and will make them extremely agitated.

I could have sat there for hours, just drinking up Jimi's riffs, with a stupid smile wide enough to make my ears fall off. Well, he (my provider) had to go to sleep. It was late for him, so I moved on. During the walk from his location to mine, I got that classic feeling that people were looking at me. Not like they thought I was high, however. It was like I felt for the first time I saw, all around, people looking at me when they thought I didn't see them looking. Who knows what that was all about. It got to the point where I felt I was altering events just by my presence, like I was a mote, determining possibilities, and people whirled around me and did things they would not have done had I not been around.

I went to see some friends for a few minutes, to see what was up. I felt uncomfortably aware of their personae. I felt as though I could divine their thoughts from their facial expressions during a discussion, in those moments when they were not talking or waiting to talk, merely watching the conversation themselves. Well, I felt really obvious and eventually ended up back at my apartment, alone. This is where the paranoia really took hold. In retrospect, I believe what I was doing was resisting the fading away of identity. Don't get me wrong; I still knew who I was, but only on an intellectual level. After about ten minutes of struggling here, I lay down and purposefully blocked out all thoughts. I replaced those thoughts with music I just created in my head (I did music in primary school and all of secondary school). It's not a hard thing to conjure music under those conditions. I just let Jimi take over for a while, turning up the mental volume whenever the heebie-jeebies got too close up. Then I expierenced something magical. I told myself to 'Just be.'

For the next hour or so, as I drifted off to sleep, Jimi's extended jam faded away to be replaced by--silence. No thought. No emotions. Just calm. Relaxation. I let my mind drift naturally after a while, and I got some of the most unusual aural sensations I've ever experienced. Imagine your brain as being equipped with full-surround sound. I heard sounds I didn't expect or force. Rumbling and revving motorcycle engines scooting off from my left and into the distance. Snatches of conversation like a television turned up loud, then quiet.

Gradually, these sounds seemed to fill in a picture that eerily matched the conditions outdoors. This was a late saturday night in a college town; people still walking around, milling, conversing. I saw those streets, as if I was walking into a dream. And with the escalating rapidity of water going down the drain, things became more vivid, more vivid, more vivid, then--pop! The sensations had become so real that I had got mentally jarred and came out of it.

To this day I don't what to make of that event. I'd always had a hopeful curiousity about out-of-body experiences, perhaps this was merely some psychological manifestation of Freudian wish fulfillment. Or maybe it was actually my spirit floating around there. That would have been truly awesome, however unprovable, and I would take shrooms again in the hopes that I could recreate that experience.

So, the brief version: giddyness evolving into a whirl of mental activity, no audiovisual hallucinations, some paranoia. Oh, and I had a little talk with myself, speaking alone to myself in the third person. That was unsettling. But no lasting side-effects. I felt fine the next morning.

Oh, one more thing before I go to bed: I had a lot of grand notions about levels of being and existence; I envisioned interesting physical models to represent the levels, and where humans fit in. I was absolutely sure of our place in the midst of a multi-planar Universe full of all different kinds of sentient creatures both bodily and ethereal. That chiseled-in-stone conviction was nothing more than a bemusing notion the next day. My interpretation: don't let sudden 'revelations' about the Universe allow you to do things in public that you wouldn't usually do. I didn't do anything stupid, but I saw how easy it was to go flying off the handle, so to speak.











8:40 PM Alone- ingested 4 oz bottle of Robo CF (Guafinesen included! Doh... oh well)

Listening to Dead Kennedys, Crass, and Black Flag on WinAmp. Some weird things starting, It feels like my brain is dissecting the properties of the music.  Fucked up...like focusing on the bass line one sec then the drums, etc..

Singing along to DK feels great, all the chords sound incredibly brilliant.

I'm simultaneously reading the faq of DXM for like the 3rd time. But it's so damn interesting.  I can't believe this shit isn't scheduled.  Hell yeah. Now some trip reports. I'm doing shit very mechanically, like I usually have to brush ants off my legs (don't ask) when I sit here at the computer and I just now realized that I brushed an ant off my leg a few minutes before without thinking.

My parents and sister will be back at about 12:00 and I need to figure out where the hell to put the Robo bottle I stole from the hall closet.  You see I'm living in Brasil for a year while my parents do research here.  I think DXM is scheduled here because wherever I ask (in Portuguese) for Cough Medicine and then specifically ask for the DXM ingredient they just look at me funny like it doesn't even exist.  So I thought, awww, fuck it just take the damn CF, to hell with guafinesen puke warnings.

I can feel each hair on my head move and my scalp gathering sweat having a little bit harder time typing, i keep forgeting where certain letters are. Well that was fun I just did a jolly run through the house and I'm sweating 4-fold, great, but I am indeed quite drunk-like.  I especially enjoy looking through the end of my binoculars backwards-style.  Its weird but everything I say weems to be a remarkably funny wittism when it's probably incredibly nonsensical to the untipped-off viewer,,, there we go again. haha 

Oh shit I forgot about WinAmp's special trip viewer modes hell yeah, excuse me a second... 

Holy fuckin shit, it felt like my face melted into the trip toy.  That was fucked. I turned off the light and its a lot harder to type. I'm sweaty as a pig. Ok some of this DK shit plain sucks like song 16 which is just like poetry.  Damnit I need music, chords, choruses---fast-forward.

Hmm, well i don't really need to keep reading about DXM I'm experiencing it right?!  Lets see if the impotence effects are true.  www.iseekpasswords.com here we cum.  

Ok first though I'm going out to experience moving and go down (I live on the 8th floor of an apt building genius) and dump this Robo bottle downstairs, be back in a sec.

Music..pause! 9:30-??

9:50 ok I'm back... play!

Damn that was exciting and it felt like hours it all started with me feeling incredibly closed in and gravity fuct by taking the elevator. When I got to ground floor I immediately tossed the bottle and went to the small playground where 4 nights prior I had stolen my neighbors red label Scotch and proceeded to get drunk off my ass and attempt to slide down the slide in the rain on my feet sideways (cinco pontos poucos/ 5 stiches on my eyebrow whoppee)  Well I peeked over this wall and what did I see but some dude, smoking a fat J in the dark crouched so noone would see him.  I was about to 'Posse eu recibir a golpe?'/'Can I get a hit?' when he bolted thinking I was some 8 year-old about to tell his mommy. I then ran up 7 flights (it felt like i had bubbles under my sandles) and then took the elevator to the 8th floor. The effects are very strong no visuals but a very cool feeling none the less,..... Anyway...

What was I doing? oh yeah impotence/whack on DXM test, one sec... eroticcinema.com members area,, woohoo. turned off music, getting annoying[note:music gets confusing after awhile], gotta hear groans and moans: Breaking It: A story of Virgins-damnit the video has plot, how fucking useless..uhh, ugly girl slow connection fuck this, new movie- no,,, new site.  Very hard time maintaining erection for more than 1 minute, this sucks.  Fuck I need a breeze or a fan I'm sweating nuts (no pun intended)

going to the ol pastime- strippers.com	hell yeah, I'm going to get off today. nope I guess they got smart to the rip-off game, just surfing pirated password sites now.. Whoah everythings kind of spinning I thought I was coming down but its only started at 10:30

ahh. vivo videos my savior... well, lets see first, damn i just looked down and I have red blotches all over my chest, fuckin weird. damnit I havent downloaded vivo player on this machine. here we go. 4 min 30 sec, jeez it'll feel like hours.  I'm feeling very nostalgic now, I think Im at an end, I don't feel very peppy and stupid, those feelings are replaced with severe drunk -like feelings and nostalgia  pour some drink.. turned off the lite, some espiao/spy was looking at me with my pants down over in the next building. Im going to go cool off by the main window to wait for this download. 3 min... damn

1 and 14 sec left - note: while walking around I can see how drinking tons of guafinesen laced Robo could make you puke but it seems I have a pretty good tolerance to the shit.  Install player and jack-off paradise we come.

ok one last try... sorry about that I had to restart the computer to get the plugin to work.  Damn It feels like I ve been transcribing hours on hours of adventuresome journeys, DXM is great. It feels like life is one long run on sentence. hmmm... that's going to be the title. finally a blowjob movie to whack to. Shit I got a call, sister there going to be back in 30 min better make this a quick jerk. Its weird my cock feels like a piece of styra-foam in my hands.  

Wow.  I think I've now experienced the most unsatisfying orgasm known to humankind. I couldn't even feel my prick let alone my 'waves of gushing pleasure'  Couples, please don't try sex on DXM, it's a complete waste of time.  Damn after all that hard work searching. Oh well, now I cant see straight (like with the MadDog 20/20s [Liquor but is labeled wine so it can be sold at gas stations] me and my buddies payed the bums to get us) and everything seems to be pulsing like [every new years when me and the buds drop lots o acid and smoke blunts till 7 in the morning.) oh this trip reminds me of my old life in Estados Unidos/U.S.  Damn Brasil, where its taboo to even smoke cigarrettes amongst my new pals from school.  How I long for the days where me and about 10 other heads walked across the school grounds to go to Rachel's house to spark a few blunts and Js or drink a couple pints of $20 Vodka in a plastic jug.  Thats one of the reasons I tryed this, ive only seen two people smoking maconha/herb here in Brasil so far and I didn't have the guts to ask for a hit either time.  I havent even heard acid or shrooms mentioned either so I figured hey, alcohol all the time? or a change of pace..  

11:30- Hmmm.. its been close to 3 hours now since I swallowed the Robo (which I found not half as bad as people say, as long as your nose is closed)and I think i'm pretty much coming down, I drank the Robo on an empty stomach and I havent had dinner so I automatically reached into the cabinet and pulled out some fish and squid shaped tropical crackers, funny thing, though, I'm not hungry at all, even though all I've eaten today is 3 small loaves of fresh baked bread and a bowl of Choco Croc. I have a feeling I'm going to get a bad hangover from this, I already have a slight headache. But I've decided this was definitely worth it, and when my friend James comes to Brasil to stay for a month I'll tell him to bring like fourteen 8 oz bottles of the shit. Towards the end my head feels very light and tingly, my body is very floaty, definite Robo-walk.  Well, my parents and sister are here, maybe I'll go play some cenouca/pool or ToTo/Foosball DXM style with my sister.

Flash-forward, next morning- Nope, I actually feel just fine if not a bit spacey. I keep staring off at things for minutes, but thats the extent of my 'hangover'.

I've decided not to edit this for any corrections or anything because the way it is, shows exactly how fucked up I was.  DXM a positive experience if not productive one.  I can see myself doing this a lot more when I get back to the U.S.  'Yeah guess what guys!? I'm back and we are going to trip nuts off cough syrup!'  Oh well.






These are my only slightly edited notes taken while on 4-HO-DiPT.

11:28 am
I had a sample of 4-HO-DiPT of known identity and purity. Butter-white fine crystals, 8.5 mg hydrochloride. I dissolved these in a small glass of Diet Coke and drank the mix down in one gulp. The beverage did a good job of moderating the somewhat nasty flavor of the drug. Im kinda scared - I Did It Now. Id had two previous brushes with this drug - the first time at perhaps 4.5 mg was awful - five hours of formless terror while my body felt All Wrong. The second time (10 mg) I had a cold, so perhaps the difficult nature of that experience had an excuse. This was try 3 at a dose chosen to push me past the unresolved terror state but still be manageable. In theory anyway. The striking feature of the 10mg event was its duration - in at 6pm one evening, and still quite intoxicated at 1am that morning, when a stout dose of alprazolam was used to get some rest. The day after that I was still off baseline for most of the morning!

I cleared my mind and asked whatever God was inclined to oblige to see to my safety. Okeydoke, here goes.

11:40 am 
Poss first alert? The feeling in my lower gut along with barely perceptible pink&green in a white surface.

11:52
Mild somatic wave - definite alert. Doing chores. Still not +1. 

12:20pm
Persistent Feeling in my lower gut. Pleasant. Hand on a cushion breathes a little. Smiling a lot. So far, so good! +1

1:16
Lying in bed. Still going in! Strong waves of ideation - somewhat disorienting. The feeling of having entered the Place frivolously, uninvited, cant be shaken. You really didnt want to be here. But youre here now for sure.

Visual is near-normal - mild breathing of edges, maybe a bit of blue&gold in surfaces. Im not completely coordinated.

1:25
Even at this modest level, the experience is flatly indescribable to those who dont know psychedelics. Hypnagogy is an inadequate surface metaphor. When I move about, the body sensation can be quite pleasant. At other times, it flirts with an alarming poisoned! quality.

1:50
Still very much in a dual state, but maximum reached and repair under way? Very ambivalent. Would like to try this one deeper, but not alone. 
I dont acess anything animistic (the tree outside is and remains just a tree) or mystical/cosmic, and I have an inkling that the price of enduring the necessary dose would be quite high. Even now Im yawning and shivering moderately. 

2:35 
It was a false repair. Still definitely +2. Waves of sensation/ideation - Im riveted still in my bed, realizing that communicating the most basic blocks (cognitive glyphs) of the experience eludes. ... Its like a panic anxiety that has been transfigured, rendered OK, into a feeling that alternates between disconcerting and occasionally beautiful - the barest hints of inner light unfolding Out.  ... And the remarkable thing is that the Observer is intact to write this down in mundane language.

2:40 
Went into a near panic when I Couldnt Find the Toilet Paper. Reasoning ability is getting hit: spent some time staring at a box trying to decipher the writing into (slowly breathing) words, then spent some more time realizing that the words made a message that didnt match the contents of the box. I can still pull it together, but its a real effort. No sign of effects subsiding.

2:47
I found the toilet paper - behind the (temporarily displaced!) toddler bed. Felt more profound relief than I really ought to have. I solemnly carried six rolls (two stacks of three) to their berth in the bathroom cabinet. 
Checked Shulgins Plus Scale - this is still a +2, even though at times the rational mind/Observer is overwhelmed. My ego is just barely intact and continuous.

2:54 
So far Ive managed to decline a Valium. My mind understands that the anxiety (if it is even that!) is chemical and thus transitory, inconsequential. Bbbbut Im still far off baseline. I am well and truly Dipped. 

3:25
Ive had a shower (washed the fight-or-flight funk from my armpits) and did some dishes. I am gently but unyieldingly pressured to realize that tryptamines arent for me. The Other is a damned good host - considering I barged in uninvited. But I must acknowledge that, having come to them so late in life, I have been guilty of romanticizing the psychedelics. They are not toys. They are not pleasure rides nor well-suited as discretionary intoxicants. I hope I have the courage and emotional memory-integrity to not come back without an invite or other extenuation.
I will trust myself to sweep up out front now. Im starting to get hungry.

3:40
Internal dialog. Sensation of wisdom/great sadness. So this is what it means to grow up. Hope I can remember. Perhaps that is the internal tragedy of this whole class of compounds. A sense that knowledge is dispensed only for that interval when it cannot be used, i.e. denied when Im sober again. I cannot remember the Basic Truth of this state when not in this state. And I am powerfully advised not to visit casually.

And yet there is tremendous peace in knowing that the underlying fabric of the cosmos abides, whether I Know or not, despite history and tyrannies and angry priests and entire generations sleepwalking. Even they fit with their own beauty into the whole. Gardan borders still breathing a little.

3:47
A migraine keeps nagging at my right temporal area. Drug body load seems diminished. Rational Observer seems better.

4:20
I walked to McDs. My Observer took a big pie in the face when confronted with the reality of talking to a stranger. I used all my internal resurces keeping it together and maintaining an inconspicuous energy signature. I got through about half the meal at a table before packing up and going home seemed like a Really Good Idea. I ran into (neighbor) on the way back and really worked at normal conversation. Im repairing, but with remarkable leisure. I wonder if duration and level of involvement isnt more typical of the normative 4-HO-DMT experience. This is no miniature of psilocin, not in me anyway!

4:25
The process of receiving a sensory stimulus - checking the internal catalog - deciding its not a problem - relaxing - starting the startle-chech-relax cycle over abd over again is very tiring. Whats it been - five hours paying full fare?

5:20
Killed some time surfing the web. Still solidly +1. Body load (a pushing feeling in boweld and backs of thighs) is frankly annoying. The pleasure/learning part of this is over and Im just paying the bills now. I still wouldnt be comfy answering the phone.

5:45
Small residues of objects breathing, apparent 10 minutes ago, are now gone. Repair under way at last. 

5:50
Or not? I set up the stereo, but I cant seem to properly listen to the music. Still +1. Extraneous sounds are still not getting automatically processed and dismissed.

6:07 
A wave of physical pleasure-feeling. So its not ALL bad. But my overall conclusion is becoming: On balance this is a difficult, demanding experience.

6:45
Consistently near but not at baseline now. Im somewhat euphoric; I got through unharmed and with a story. Now to just try to remember that even this gentlest by reputation of the serious psychedelics. Is. Not. A. Toy.  Youve been advised.

8:00
Still not out of it. Waves of dislocation disabuse me from saying its over. I want baseline back.  Im very selective what Im watching on TV. I have no tolerance for harsh vibes. Watching spiders mate was horrifying. 

9:20
Very chilled - put a jacket on. Calling all clear; nearly ten hours. Short-acting, yuh right.  DOB would probably kill me outright. 

11:30
Twelve-hour mark.  Still tailing. Trying to sleep is difficult, even after 30 mg temazepam. Am taking 5 mg Valium to simply disengage.







My friend and I had made our way over to a record shop to see a few local bands and stumbled upon a friend whom offered to sell us some weed. Being quite glad we ran into him we purchased a 15 sac and made our way over to the concert. 

After arriving there and staying for about an hour we decided to go smoke up with a few friends whom we conveniently ran into. We arrived at his garage and had a beer. Than he pulled out a bowl and a half ounce and started passing it around.  We left after what seemed like 30 minutes. 

We arrived at my friends house and smoked some of our 15 sac. Then found ourselves in his brothers bedroom listening to Ministry. I was wearing my SFX contact lenses which made my eyes red and yellow. I started mouthing the words to the song and air guitaring to it. My friend started cracking up and saying my eyes looked like they were on fire. He said he thought I was Satan and started geeking out a little bit, so  I decided to stop. Than started poking at his eyes but not really touching them. He grabbed his eyes and started moaning like I had really poked him. He said it felt like his pupils were going into the back of his head and down into his throat. I started cracking up but at the same time a sense of fear had come over me. So I tried to take control and decided that we go downstairs and eat something. We walked into the kitchen and he puked into the sink and repeated trying to puke when there was nothing left.

I was trying to control my laughter considering the fact that I was scared out of my mind. Yet I still managed to try to calm him down and myself as well. By now I realized we had to be tripping some sort of way. We had gone back to his brothers room and started watching TV. He had gone to bed because his head was spinning and he couldn't take it. I was overcome with fear of my friend getting this weird idea in his head and coming into the room and murdering me, so I locked the door. Than I heard a voice in the back of my head telling me to go do what I just thought. I was staring at a sharpened pencil laying on the ground than geeked out and threw the covers over my head. I squeezed my eyes shut in hopes to fall asleep.

I woke up a few minutes later to find myself in the same state. I went downstairs to get something to eat. Somehow I managed to cook eggs and wrap them up in a burrito with cheese. I sat down to eat it and kept on seeing someone in the doorway out of the corner of my eye. I just ignored it. After taking a few bites the burrito started to taste real bad. I looked at it and the eggs were all liquidy and looked like some sort of mush. I spit it out on the plate and threw it away. Than ran up stairs into the same room, locked the door, and forced myself asleep.







The first times I took this drug it affected me hardly at all. So one day I said 'screw this' and took 5 g. I got *loaded*.

Since then, I take anywhere from 2.5 - 3 g at a shot. Sometimes I'll follow up with a 2 g dose to prolong the experience.

I love the effects, but get a distinct and unpleasant hangover that lasts anywhere from 24 - 36 hours after it wears off. I'm jittery and irritable, and have trouble sleeping. There is also a persistent salty/metallic taste in my mouth.

 I think this stuff does a number on your brain chemistry. I never do it two days in a row. It does not surprise me at all that it's reported to be addictive. 

I'd be careful with this stuff, if I were you. It has quite a bit more abuse/harm potential than pot.







my sister and i decided to get what we thought might be a 'high' one night in december and nearly died. i decided to take 16 caffeine pills with a 200 mg amount of caffeine in each pill (equivalent to 2 cups of coffee) and drink a diet coke. my sister liked the idea because she thought it might be like speed. it was like hell. i shit three times i peed like a race horse about three times. i also thought maybe consuming some good h2o and some nourishing food might help but everything that went into my body came back up. i had an intense headache and body temperature that seemed to range from boiling to arctic freezing. i reached a point where i could not stop tremoring or shaking and my heart was pounding out of my chest. i really thought i was going to die. my sister had taken half the amount that i did and saw what i was going through. i had called an ambulance and was carried out in a stretcher and just about bounced out out of it from being unable to keep still. on the way to the hospital i blacked in and out and the blackouts got longer and longer. i was given numerous amounts of shots and hooked up to hooplas of equipment and was told to drink charcoal or i would die. my sister, i later found out went through the same thing just when i was hooked up to all of the monitors and what not. we were both told that we could have died from the amount of caffeine that we had taken. 

my reason for telling this to whomever is reading it would be, be aware of what how much something can do to you. i just thought i would be very awake. it turns out i was almost asleep permanently.









It was April 1997 and I was packing for a school band trip to Tennessee. We would be gone for 5 days, so I wanted to be certain I had packed everything necessary. As I was in the middle of this, the phone rang. It was one of my friends telling me she had found some good acid for me. As my parents were at home, she couldn't bring it to the house, and I was leaving in the morning at 6:30, so I told her I would put the 15 dollars in an envelope and throw it out into my front yard, I even put in a couple of quarters in order to make the envelope heavier, in order for it to fall where I wanted it...So, I opened my second-story window and threw it down. My friend came by, picked up the money and taped the cellophane which enclosed the dipped paper into the inside of my mailbox. Upon rising in the early morning hours, I took my suitcases down to the driveway before my parents could follow me and quickly extracted the package from its hiding place. I had 3 hits in my possession now. I was so anxious. When would I take them? On the road trip? When I got back? On top of all this, it would be my first trip! What amazing experiences I was expecting! I accidently lost one of the squares of paper, though, when I was cutting along the penciled lines which separated each hit...it somehow fell behind my dresser, but I had to leave, so I departed with my two hits.

I got on the bus for the long ride at about 7:00 that morning. It was extremely boring. I attempted to listen to some music on my headphones and do some schoolwork, but nothing of interest came to me. Then, I remembered that I had the acid. Wow, I thought, that's something to do. (something extraordinarily stupid, but i didn't realize it at the time.) So, not actually realizing how incapacitated I was about to become, I placed one of the squares onto my tongue. By this time, it was about 9:00. Although I was aware of the effects of LSD, anyone who has ever tried it knows that there is no way to tell someone inexperienced exactly what to expect. I waited for about 30 minutes, and, not feeling anything yet, decided to take the other hit. By 10 AM, I was hit with the most utterly fantastic experience that I could never even imagine. Each of my friends was being seen for the very first time. My friend in the seat in front of me turned around and placed her over-sized headphones on my ears for a minute. I explored every note touched in the song. I swam around on the sound waves. The music flowed straight through my mind. I was completely overwhelmed. 

Since all of my frineds on the trip were completely anti-illegal anything, I was the only one who was aware of my situation. One friend inquired as to the strange state which my eyes were in, but i just said i didn't know, and continued to awake for what seemed like the first time ever. Every voice on the bus surrounded my mind. One would call out my name in slow motion while the other would echo an infinite number of times. I almost couldn't bear the liveliness around me. I felt as if I was essentially progressing forward, but at the same time, one stream of my consciousness was jetting into the future, while another was lurching behind in the past. everytime someone said something I felt as if I knew what they were going to say before they did, but at the same time I was hearing it for the first time when it left their lips, but then I felt as if I was hearing it just after they  said it. I was enveloped in a battle between the past, present and future. I felt like spinning.

Once we arrived at our mid-point hotel, I was in the midst of the most glorious trip. I had also become obsessed with the foreign nature of my toes and the skin that covered them. I could not stop examining them in my clear plastic sandals. Later, after the most intense bites of salad and sips of coke at dinner, I acquired the most wonderful feeling. I, in about 10 seconds, figured out everything. I discovered the language that human should be speaking. It was the most perfect laguage. It was so perfect though, and it was all jetting through my bring so incredibly quickly, that I could not relay it to a single soul. My thoughts were not compatible with any known words. In this time, I had discovered how to obtain perfection in the world. I found the beauty in every single image that flashed through my mind. I realized the perfection in all life, which is normally viewed as just the opposite. I was so sure that I would be able to tell people of the most wonderful language when I came down. Finally, 15 hours after I dropped the hits (yes, I said 15), I started to come down. I was able to force myself to sleep and try to remember everything I had learned that day. 

Unfortunately, of course, when I woke up, the language and the perfection were gone. Every thought and insight that had seemed so intricate in the weaving of my existence had been pushed behind my consciousness. I could not retrieve it. Yet, from that day on, I have continued to find beauty in unexpected places, and people. That day is still regarded as home to one of the most significant experiences of my life. Hopefully, it will never all fade away, and I will be able to look back and remember something about that utter perfection that I saw for that short time, and the most beautiful sounds from the perfect language that ran through my head. I will always have a desire to go back to that point, and I wish that everyone could have experienced that with me. It was truly amazing, and I believe I will cherish it for the rest of my life.










I am a reasonably well balanced thirty something who has a good job, a circle of friends and who enjoys life. I have never been in any trouble; just an 'ordinary Joe' who works, pays the bills and has holidays once a year.

I visited some friends in another city about 600 hundred miles away for a long weekend.  We had a couple of joints and then they asked me if I like to do some 'charlie'.  Well I had always wanted to try the stuff so I said yes.

After my first line I felt really good, warm, positive, confident and chatty.  The whole experience felt really good.  I returned home with 2 grams 'just to socialise with' but as soon as I got through the door I was snorting the stuff.  The following week I felt totally lost without coke.  So I drove 600 miles to get some more.  This time 4 grams.  Before I knew it I had my friend post it to me every week. I could not believe how much I was spending on the stuff.  This went on for about 4 months.

Pretty soon it got to the point where I could not leave the house without 4 - 5 heavy lines.  I knew I was in trouble when one day I was on my hands and knees, with a straw up my nose, looking for traces of coke on the floor.

I had a nervous breakdow/depression and was off work for nearly 4 months.  Perhaps the breakdown would have happened any way but the charlie certainly sped it up.  

I have not touched the stuff in over three years and I certainly could not stop thinking about it for two years.  I even used to dream about it!  I'm ok now.  Back to being an ordinary Joe who is a little wiser and who doesn't need any drugs now.







DISCLAIMER: This is just a story, the people and events in this story are purely fictitous and any resmblances made to any human beings are simply coincidental.

Now with that out of the way let me tell you about my meeting with the Green Goddess. It was about two weeks ago that my first shipment of Salvia came in. I had heard wonderous reports about its effects and I just had to try it. Not because I'm some drug crazed freak, but because I felt destined to partake. 

I wasn't thrilled about using a new substance by my self. So once receiving the shipment I made like Aries, and went to my friend J's house. You see J was the perfect person to join in a ceremony with me. He is a spiritual psychonaught with peaceful Utopian tendancies.

Once arriving at J's abode we decided to take a walk in the snow filled woods, to the harmonious womb of nature. There we would find the peaceful area in which we would wish to try to embrace the mysts of Salvia.

It was about 9:00pm or so, if I recall correctly, that we took our first hit. J went first then me. As soon as he took his hit he started wobbling around as if he had drunk himself into a stupor. He started raving 'Am I all right! What's going on?!' I couldn't believe that he was actually having any effects off just one hit. I asked him if he was faking it and if he was seriously off his rocker. He just responded in a way that made no sense. Speaking half phrases and insane jibberish.

I decided it was my turn so I took a hit and instantaneously I looked to my right and saw a huge vanilla ice cream with a cherry on top, sitting on the horizon. I just became completely over whelmed and fell over to my left in the snow. I tryed to get back up but was unable in succeding for what seemed a minute or two.

Once I was able to get back on my feet I noticed that all the trees around me were giving off a blue glow. I felt that the force that had just been over me was rapidly leaving. J still was stupifid he didn't know wich way was up or down. Every utterance he made was repeated by a complete contradiction.

After about 10 min or so, we were pretty much down except for the fact J still couldn't make sense of too much. We both thought we had just touched on something that was much bigger in scope than what we had just experienced. That's when we decided that we would venture a little further and take another hit each.

So we found a nice spot, in between to pines, to sit down and take another go around. I took the first hit this time and I again saw the blue glow around the trees around me. I felt invigorated and got up and went off on a walk. I vaguely remember saying I was going to hunt some rabbits.

J was left sitting on his own when he took his hit. I was coming back to where he was because I didn't want to leave him on his own while he was stupified. When I got back to where he was in the woods, I found him speaking in the most absurd ways. He would say, ' I need to go run now' followed by, 'I feel sick' then he started laughing. He fell over backwards into the snow and said,  'I need to sit down now'. He just kept on saying and doing these contradictory things for the next 5 to 7 min. until we were down into what we now call the Enlightened stage. 

After smoking that last time we left the woods and started on down the road back to J's house. On the way back we noticed we felt completly envigorated in the mind and our bodies felt completly relaxed. We felt as though we were truely enlightened. The level of our discusions were far beyond that of the 'marijuana universe pondering'. We thought of some truely abstract, yet realistic ideas of who and what we truely are. These enlightened effects lasted the rest of the evening, for the both of us.

This was to be the first in a chain of of Salvia experiences. The first attempt at meeting the Green Godess only peeked through the key hole in the door to her house. We would later be invited right inside. 

But that is a story for another time.........








I have done nitrous on various occasions for years.  When doing nitrous there is a point that you reach when everything in the physical and non-physical world meet. Everything comes together as one and I feel it is the meaning of true consiousness. The most frustrating part of it is trying to describe what exactly it is that you feel.  Everything is so clear while on it and I have the whole 'life' thing figured out.  Everything good and bad all come together in a fully connected swirl.  It is very hard for me to put in to words but it is definitely a higher state of consciousness (moreso than just a drug experience).  I think that the eastern religions have this figured out and is ultimately where they are going or trying to reach when meditating and putting themselves in a 'trance' state.  I have tried many times describe it physically and I think that the yin-yang symbol possibly depicts the oneness of consciousness.  (Everything black and white...good and bad...conscious and un-conscious are part of one whole.) It is one big swirl and there is no way out persay. Everyone and everything thing is connected and is just part of the bigger picture. THere is much much more to this but as I said it is hard for me to put into words.  I JUST KNOW! So next time think of what I have said when doing that balloon and hopefully you can help me describe it into words.  If everyone could figure this out, and as a world see this big picture, We...as humans..would evolve and as James Redfield referenced in THE CELESTINE PROPHECY...A Mass Awakening would occur and make it possible to move to the 'next level', in which I believe is connecting life and death as one. I have come to realize this because of nitrous and if it sounds unconvincing please just give it a thought while on nitrous.







I tried my first dose of Meth around August 1996, my life was starting to spiral down around me and things were getting pretty difficult to deal with.  My wife (thankfully now ex-wife) was a hard core speed freak, and I the anti-drug.  She got me to try it once, and that was all I needed.  First time through was a tiny little line of this brownish-looking sticky stuff, probably cut a few dozen times with God only knows what.  It wasn't all that great, put me in a pretty good mood for a few hours, but still enough to get me wanting more.

When I got back home to California (this all started in Florida, as I was leaving the Navy) it really started in earnest, I learned how to purify it to try and minimize the effects of the cut.  I went from 165 lbs when I started to a shade under 120 (damned thin for six feet tall!) and my trips lasted longer and longer.  Once towards the end I stayed up an entire solid week, rewiring a friend's (also my supplier, seriously good stuff!) Volkswagen bus.  By the end of that trip I was so tired and shaky that I was hallucinating more than any LSD ever made me.  I didn't even know where I was, just that I was high and fixing something.  I was always really laid back, not a care in the world, as long as I had the drug and something to tweak on I was happy.

Then in late December, after hitting rock bottom (and neither noticing nor caring), my girlfriend, one of our mutual friends, and I were in my VW bus in a parking lot (where we all lived at the time) getting very much spun when...bright lights...cops with guns...Miranda rights...oops!  They found almost a full 1/8th ounce (8-ball, roughly 4.3 grams) in the van, and that was the end of that story.  My GF was extradited out of state for a prior she had there, my friend gave 'em a fake name and was never heard from again, and I got 2 years of probation.

I've been clean off Meth for a little over three years now (I had to go clean for my probation, due to frequent random piss tests) and I'm still craving a line.  The worst part is that it screws up the parts of your brain that produce Serotonin, the hormone that makes one happy.  So now my brain is perpetually depressed.  Up 4 months, down forever.

Best advice to anyone thinking of trying meth, don't.  While it's not physically addictive, it's so much fun getting spun that you'll never want to stop, even as your life self destructs.  To those currently using it, be careful and please try to quit. The long term effects simply aren't worth it.







It was my 20th birthday. My friend invited me to one of his friends' house to smoke out. Anyway, about a 20 minutes after I got there we started to pass around the bong. After about 5 rounds we stopped and sat around for like 10 minutes. One of my friends asked me if I wanted to have a balloon and I did. He filled the balloon with two whippits cartridges. We then went into a dark room which had a bean bag in the corner. I sat on the bean bag and he closed the door. He began to give me a light show by holding a green LED flashlight in each hand. He began making circles and other such patterns by moving his hands and arms really fast. I then exhaled all the air that was in my lungs and brought the balloon to my mouth. I inhaled almost the whole balloon and held it for about 5 seconds. I then began to breath into and out of the balloon slowly and deliberatly. I soon heard the 'helicopter' noise. The noise came on fast but after awhile got slower until it was silent. I do not know if I was still breathing into or out of the balloon at all or even if I was still holding it. As the helicopter noise grew slower and softer my friend's movement got slower until he was completly stopped in time and the 'helicopter' noise had totally frozen. During this whole time my thoughts kept going while it seemed timed had frozen. I felt so comfortable were I was. I thought this was it. I thought I was dead. I was scared, but comfortable were I was. I kept thinking wait... not yet... not yet. Then there was another voice in my head besides my own. It was telling me, 'God knows were you are.' Over and over. I was getting more scared and more scared. Eventually the 'helicopter' noise started back up again, very slowly, and steadily. I then felt so relieved that I was coming back... my friends arms began to move again sychonized with the speed of the helicopter sound as it came back. When I was back I couldn't stop laughing cause I felt so relieved. I've tried several times to get time to freeze again using whippits, but have failed. =(

Bowling isnt the most entertaining sport when sober. But when your fucked up it can be pretty fun.

After skipping half the day of school me and 3 friends decided to go bowling. But first a stop at the computer store. We picked up a can of duster (air keyboard cleaner). Now the day became very interesting. 

It was probally my 3rd time doing duster. Other times were not very intense but this time was unexplainable. We start passing the can around the car getting fucked up each time. We went bowling for a few hours which was very hard. I fell 5-6 times and tossed the ball backwards ect.

This is were the story gets interesting. On the way home we all passed it and took as much as we could, including the driver. (mistake!) Im sitting shotgun so I take 3-4 hits then pass it over to the driver. He takes 5 or so. As we drive down a 5 lane street. BAAAM!! The car smashes into a curb. Everyone is screaming 'Stop the fucking car!!', 'WAKE UP!!' going around 45 on the sidewalk for about 50 yds. I look at the driver. His head was leaned all the way back and eyes rolled back.

Suddenly the car drifts onto the 5 lane street at 3:00 in the afternoon. 'That was crazy' im thinking to my self. right when errrrTT!@!!  the car jerks onto oncomming trafic. We dodged a red grand prix and slid to the other curb! BAMM!! A kid from in back throws the car into park. As we come to a complete stop we are 2 inches from hitting a huge computer store sign.

Lesson: never take any inhalents and drive, you can get really fucked up doing inhalents. there alot more intense then some think!






With much mental preparation, my coleagues and I had a small test line of the ketamine that we had taken from a liquid to a powder. Snorted just a bit to be sure of not having a negative reaction. Each of us was fine after 15 minutes and then sniffed a full line. In 5 minutes I thought I needed to sit down before I fell down. Peaking already, I saw my friends moving slowly around the patio and I rose to my feet. While I did not fall down, my body movements were all over the place as was my mouth. The words were intelligible, but i was saying things that I would not normally saw. 

I did not understand the term disassociatives before. Now I understand. My mind left my physical body. Arms and legs flailing around like a serious hadicap and feeling reaaly groovy. Aside from the naseau, I felt great, albeit out of control. I kept wondering what I might do if a visitor were to arrive. No way that I could conceal this buzz. I have tried lots of potent drugs over the years, but this one might be the strongest. After my experience, at least 3 months went by before I thought I might try Ketamine again. Use with caution.








The weekend just passed (Feb 18th/19th) was a weird one for me, even weirder than the last couple I've had. The reason? It was an acid weekend, a REAL acid weekend.

When I arrived at the fortnightly 24hour club I do volunteer work for, I immediately found out what the Psychoactive situation was like. There was some good skunk (MJ), some excellent pills and a lot of acid was expected to arrive later on. I bought a pill, and took it just after the club opened, at 11 pm on Friday. I took a while to come up, but at about 12 pm I started rushing hard and spent a good few hours enjoying one of the cleanest ecstasy highs I had had for a long time. They were big pills, and would not let you down for more than a minute or so. Then you were back up again, waving your arms to whatever thumping beat you could lay your ears on. I took another 'millenium' pill at 2 pm, and then at about 3.30 the acid came into the club. The first two I bought where called 'sheevas', marked red and green and apparently exported from India. We sat down in the psychedelic café (it seemed like the best place to be), I took the first trip, and at about 4.20 split the second with a friend (who had also consumed one already). 

It took a while to start kicking, but by 5.00 I was seeing some isolated visuals, which were perhaps exaggerated by the use of a violently green lamp. One image that was particularly striking was that of a man sitting, propped up against the wall with his head in one hand. Instead of the fingers resting on the surface of his skin, they went into the face through deep, black holes that  obscured any features the man may have had. I squinted, but the image remained and I knew the acid had started. The usual warping face phenomenon appeared around me and although it was mild, I was sure that this was only the beginning. My friend X......, however, was getting rather irritable, claiming that all he could feel was a weak preliminary mushroom sensation, and that his level of visual disturbance was very low. So I decided, under pressure from X...... to get two more trips. 

We left the cafe we had been sitting in and went upstairs to a room in which a visual DJ was performing to hoards of tripped out acid-freaks. He was showing footage of the N30 demonstration in Seattle and London, but fucking around with the image, colour and sound to such an extent that it became an insane, warped acid experiment, with L.S.D-fuelled clubbers freaking out, or losing themselves in the consuming, often terrifying atmosphere of the place. 

Sitting at a table at the far end of this room was another acid dealer, but much older than the one who had sold me the 'sheevas' (that one could have only been in his early twenties, perhaps not even that). This dealer looked like a middle-aged business man, except that his eyes gave away the fact that he was an acid freak. He charged me £3 ($4.5 roughly) per trip, which is the usual price, and then turned to me and warned:

'This is strong acid; be careful!' 

I dropped the piece of card instantly,  unable to work out what was printed on it (the design, whatever it was, kept tripping me out). It could have been a Batman, as other friends of mine had bought that, but I cannot be sure. We then returned to the cafe to begin tripping hardcore.

The madness started almost instantly and I knew I had gone too far. I had only tripped with mushrooms at this type of event before, and I knew how far the clients and staff go to make your time (or absense of time) as fucked up as possible. The whole experience is about seeing and feeling things that you could never ever feel anywhere else. To be there is enough. To trip there is beyond enough. I expected a crazy time, but not as crazy as it turned out to be.

Most of my time was spent in the cafe. Once the wall started to move properly and intensely, I realised I was not going to be able to move very easily, and certainly would not want to for a good deal of time. The classics appeared, colours (not much red, a lot of green (caused by green lighting)), patterns, lines marking people's faces moving, exaggerating and stretching, electronicy closed-eye visuals etc. There was constant movement, but I could not really see any of the things that were causing it. The air around was shirling, moving, shifting with music that was playing from somewhere within the body of the cafe. Friendly faces I knew and others I didn't passed, sometimes stopping to have a conversation with me, sometimes drifting away. Everyone was tripping, and most were tripping on the same acid. It is one of the only places were hundreds of people can be seen tripping at the same time. 

Some people were there to play with your mind; one particular man who I discovered sitting in another cubicle with his head lifted up so it was next to mine. Much of what he said came out as nonsense, the syllables seemed to mix and match without any assitance from me, but when I closed my eyes, instead of hearing his voice, I heard his breath, softly moving in and out. I knew that he was in my head, but I wasn't really concerned. He was trying to soothe me, and it was working. When I opened my eyes, he lifted, from somewhere beneath him, a techy-looking camera and with typically jerky acid movements got up and began to act as if he was filming another of the trippers sitting in the cubicle just behind mine. That really freaked me out. What was going on! He left after that and floated off into the madness elsewhere. 

People appeared like that for many hours, playing games, freaking us out, soothing our spirits, trying to lift us out of bad patches, of which I had many. For a long time I felt that I was unwelcome, that I was an outsider because I was too into my trip to talk. I began to feel guilty that I was not doing more to become more a part of the whole thing. Those came on and off, and I was still able to enjoy periods of level 5 whenever I closed my eyes for more than a few minutes, and constant, relentless, often incredibly real and hard-hitting visuals. Sometimes I had to turn away from what I was seeing, because more often than not it would be so inexplicable and so beyond human understanding that I  worried whether or not I would ever be able to understand anything ever again.

About 8 hours into the trip, I crushed one pill, separated it into two lines, and gave one to X......  We snorted our lines, and instantly the visuals became very happy and pill-orientated. It seemed like the whole room hd just done some MDMA and were experiencing the whirring eye/grating teeth effects that are so common with E. The reason why the trip had gone very dark was probably because it coincided for a while with the MDMA come down. Taking more E brought us back up into full CandyFlipping. 

Unfortunately we got some bad vibes from people around us who thought we were doing lines of Ketamine, but once that was cleared up, things started to go well again. I was still tripping my nuts off, and having real trouble stringing any interesting sentences togethers, so I lay back in my seat and closed my eyes, ready to go flying into my mind:

Energy. That's all I really remember. I could almost control the flow of my mind, the flow of its energy. I would whirl round, producing patterns, leaving marks, changing perspective and colour. Everything was perfectly mathematical, but so complicated that my basic maths could not even attempt to explain it. It doesn't need explaining. You know what it means when you experience it. It cannot be put into words.

Two of my companions went up to the bar and returned with two plates of food, claiming they were going to eat vegetarian sausage rolls. The objects did not look like sausage rolls. They were utterly repulsive, and looked like they were almost alive, moving and pulsating as each piece was lifted up to a hungry open mouth. My two friends had come down, but me and X....... was still peaking after eight or so hours. We realised then that we had been excessive; the last trip we had taken was certainly unnecessary.

Sometime later I was back in the graphics DJ room. They were playing 'Maria' by Blondie, but in a fucked-up acid style. It sounded like it was being played on a 'My first Radio' tape-deck with some crazy sounds instead of the usual instruments. This was the most horrible part of my trip. It's not that I don't like Blondie, but her voice sounded so shrill and horrible at that moment. It conjured up terrible images of my past that I wanted to forget. This was followed by a psychedelic trance version of Cher 'Do you Believe'. It was a really weird and really intelligent mix, but I just couldn't stay in that room so I went down to the basement where there was a pagan/mystical/trippy play being performed with pixie-band performers, mandolins and tribal stomping (crazy huh!) . I went very tribal for a while, and joined the other dancers in their strange, round-the-fire dance routine that was so strange and so beautiful.

I left the club at around 2.30 pm. I was still tripping, and the sunlight really hurt my still furiously dilated pupils. They still ache a little now from that. As I walked up to the bus stop, it seemed like everybody walking down the street (this is a huge, busy London street) was tripping as well. I looked at as many eyes as I could, and I was sure that they were moving in a way that was half ectasy whirring  and half acid manic jumping around. I got on the bus and tripped off the patterned plastic wall until I got home, and went to bed with a very sore-head that was still full of crazy visions. I had a lot to sleep over, but now I feel better than I ever had. Trips are the best form of therapy for me, and the harder and more intense they are, the more I learn about myself. This one has to be the most astral, mind-blowing trip I've ever had. I going back for another one as soon as I can.








I will never forget my first and only experience with LSD.  One night after work my ex-friend called me.  He asked if I wanted to come over and go on a trip.  I was very excited and I rushed over.  When I got there my friends (we will call D.B. and J.K. were there along with a boy who I did not know.  D.B. pulled out six hits of an acid called Dancing Condoms, it was a puzzle with little dancing condoms on it.  It was me and the other boy's first time so we only took a half of a hit. I waited about 45 minutes and nothing was happening.  I noticed that the other boy was acting very weird.  I thought maybe the acid was fake so I took the rest of the dancing condom and 3/4 of a hit of white blotter.

A little later D.B. went to get some bud.  When he got back we smoked 1 good sized bowl.  About a minute after the bowl I was feeling very fucked up.  At first I felt very high and started to laugh at evrything.  D.B. and I went back to his room to get another bowl.  I was sitting on his bed and I dazed off I had thoughts of life and death without even trying to think about it.  Suddenly the whole room caved in on me and I came out of the daze.  D.B. kept talking to me but I didn't even know where I was.  I could not comprehend why I was this fucked up.  I looked at the pot and all I saw was pine needles.  I asked D.B. if that was what we smoked and he asked me what I was talking about. I looked again and It was regular marijuana.

We went in the living room and sat down.  I kept dazing off and suddenly the room went dark ond colors of neon green and pink were everywhere.  I felt like I was all alone and nobody else realy existed but they were all just images.  I was looking at my arms and they turned into clay and crumbled to the ground.  Everybodies hair was changing color and everyones faces were scrambling around.  I was feeling very scared.  D.B. took me in the other room and he kept yelling at me.  He told that the demons were coming and I was going to go to hell.  Suddenly I saw a flash of light and D.B. became a demond.  The vains were popping out of his head and his eyes were dripping blood and hirns came out of his head.  I started talking to J.K. and he calmed me down he told me it was from the acid and D.B. was just trying to scare me.  In the middle of our talk his face formed into another demon and he was screaming at me.  I was looking at the walls and it was covered with huge pentagrams.  After a few hours of running through the house screaming I finally came down. 

After that, ever time I smoked weed I saw designs on the walls.  I started to trip one time after 2 gravity bong hits.  The room was melting and I was extremely paranoid.  If I didn't have a bad trip my first time I would probably do it again, but out of fear I will never take it again.








Having previously had about 1 g of Salvia a night for the past 5 days, and had good experiences each time, I thought I was now ready for a more powerful experience. I packed a large bowl full of salvia leaf (carefully crumbled) using the scientific Buchner funnel as a bong. It has very close tolerances, and the flow of smoke throughout is great.

I turned the lights off so the room was completly dark, and used a laser pointer to navigate my way to the CD player. I put on the DJ Scott Project 'How Deep Is Your Love'. About 5 minutes long, I put it on a reasonable volume. Even without drugs this was a worthwhile experince. Not having any sight makes the music seem amazing.

Anyway, I held two lighters to the salvia until it glowed red hot. I then took a huge toke, and felt the burning smoke go into my lungs. I breathed a bit more air in, and held it for 30 seconds. Even after this the effects become more noticable; the music gets louder, and my vision had had the usual salvia blues around the edges. However, I still had my senses, and I took another great toke, holding the lighters to the salvia whilst breathing in. I held this in as long as I could, and let it out as I lay down. 

However, the weirdest thing then happened. Instead of feeling solid floor underneath my back, I sort of just swung around so I was sitting on the bottom of the floor. Imagine a pin going through your feet sideways, and pivoting on that, and that's how it was. I wasn't upside down though, I was the right way up. As if I had my own plane of gravity. I then proceeded to move on an airport style lift, whilst in front of me there were many people, blue and red, sitting down. They formed a huge word - LOVE. I remember marvelling at the word - a feat of human engineering I thought. Meanwhile, in the song a loud voice was saying in a Barry White style voice 'You know what I mean... It's all about LOVE' As usual , a female force was directing the whole event, and her voice was occasionally heard. I have no recollection of how long this lasted, or if I had my eyes open or closed. Next thing I know my sense had sort of returned and I remember trying to test if this dimension was real by grabbing one of the people as I travelled by the massive love. To my surprise, I felt something solid under my hands! I was very excited, as I couldn't wait to tell my friends that a Salvia dimension physically existed. I was also a bit scared that I wouldn't be able to get back to the normal dimension.

Next thing I know I've sat up, and am a few yards over the room to where I was, staring at my hands. I'm still holding the lighters very tightly, and I literally gasp out loud and start breathing really heavily as I realised what I've just done. The music sounded plain annoying, so I turned it off, and the bloke's voice was just scary. 

I couldn't believe that the Salvia had engineered the trip from the start to involve me holding the lighters. I still can't really comprehend how it knew I'd be holding the lighters, or how it knew I'd grab hold of one of the people.  It really overwhelms me how real it was. It was like I was in another dimension.

Having only done 'fun' drugs (hash resin, shrooms) I really can't compare it to any substances like 2-CB or DMT. But for me this was the peak of my salvia experiences. Having done it several times more after this, it's never really compared. I learned from this trip that there is a greater meaning to everything, and love really is important, if not the most important thing in human lives. Sounds a bit hippy I know, but it seems so true now.

I am totally overcome by the fact that the Salvia or my brain could engineer such a detailed trip and  predict and make the trip to what I had previously decided or was going to decide to do. I also am in awe of why _everybody_ gets a woman's voice and presence. Surely this proves that other forces DO exist.







I couldn't tell you when I became addicted to coke. I realized it when one day when I couldn't get any. Im 16 yrs old and I am a coke head. Last month I weighed about 150 pounds. Now I weigh between 120-125. I cant eat. My entire life is planned around coke. This past week I spend about $900 on it. My closet friends call me a coke head. I throw up almost every day. Somedays my nose hurts so bad I can't snort coke, so I'll buy some crack. I do about 4 lines before school, and more lines whenever I can sneak them in. I carry my coke with me everywhere. Everytime I do a line it makes me want to cry because I know that I'm hurting the person that I care most about. But I cant stop. I used to tell myself that it would never be this bad, that I wouldn't let it happen. I guess nobody's that strong. I've thought before about trying to quit, but Im not sure if Im ready yet. 

I feel like shit all the time. When Im on coke and when Im not on it. I get so weak sometimes I cant walk. In school I can hear kids whispering about me. They say there she is, shes the coke head. They walk by me and snort. You know its bad when the people that you sometimes snort it with tell you that you might want to slow down. I ran out of money a long time ago. Now I sell whatever I can. I had a job but I got fired, and now I dont have the energy to look for a new job. Nothing gets me going anymore. The other day I looked in the mirror and the reflection staring back at me didnt even look familar. One day before school I did a little too much. I puked and started shaking really bad, I got dizzy and I thought I was going to die. That was when I knew that this was serious. I had become what I promised myself I would never be. A junkie.







I had a pretty messed up experience the other night. Heres what happened.....

I heard that eating too many Dramamine makes you trip so I said what the hell. I am an experianced shroomer, drinker, and pot head.

I went to the store and bought two tubes(24 tablets) of Dramamine.
I went home and took them all, 12 in each handfull with Sunny D. After about an hour all I felt was a slight stoned feeling. 

I got pissed off that I spent 10 bucks on bullshit and I was feeling really drowsy so I just went to sleep saying, fuck this, what a bunch of crap. Well I woke up about 3 hours later and I couldn't tell what the hell was going on. I was in all my clothes in the bathtub and it seemed like everything I was seeing was normal. My friends appeared to be sitting on the couch watching TV and smoking weed. I just said hi and went to the kitchen, or so I thought. 

When I tryed to grab somthing out of the fridge the thing wasn't there anymore and I was on the floor and my friends weren't there. I was like 'what the hell is up with that?' Then I felt this prickley feeling in my neck, arms, legs and back. 

When I looked at my arms there was a bunch of ticks burrowing in to my skin. It hurt like hell. I started getting scared and thought about Lyme disease.

I got a sewing needle and started digging into my skin trying to get them out. But then I'd look and they were gone. I was like oh shit they dug down all the way. I called my grandma whos only 50 and knows about my drugs i did a while ago (i got caught with shrooms, I'm 14) I told her I had ticks and to come over right away. See I didn't realize it was 5 in the morning but she came anyway.

She got here in her robe and looked for ticks but she said there was nothing there. By now I had completely forgotten i took the dramamine. She said I was hallucinating and asked me what I was on. I said nothing. She looked at my eyes and said my pupils took up my whole eye. I said it was cuz i was tired.

I convinced her i must have had a dream. She said ok, after that everything is a big blackout like a big hazy dream. I can't remember if I went with her to her house or if i stayed here or what but the next thing I remember is being on the couch and I felt like shit (bad hangover if u try this).

Pretty much the whole damn trip you get on that much dramamine is like a dream that seems completely real. You will think you are doing things and going places you really arent and talking to people that aren't there. The weirdest thing is how real it seems. It was all cool except my dumb ass calling my grandma and seeing the ticks. It would propbably be best to do it with a friend. Next time i do it i'm doing it with a friend.

Its a good drug if u want to lose complete connection with reality. Don't do it around your parents, and have a sitter.






The setting and mood was joyful. I had been away for about six months and could only stay a couple of days. I had been clean for the time I had been gone, and was expecting my tolerances to be near nothing. 

2:00 p.m. - half a black gel was downed

3:00 p.m. - the effects are becoming noticable. I have mild stimulation and am intigued by the most simple objects. The music is wonderful and I complement my friend on his excellent taste as we drive to the mall. I arrive at the mall with all intents a tripping teenager. Not many visuals but I felt a sense of joy which I had not grasped in some time; a piece of myself had come back.

9:00 p.m. - ate the rest of the gel

9:50 p.m. - I did not know that I could 'build' on (the effect) with acid, from what someone else had told me, but I was now experiencing the total ramification of a single hit. Laughing; tripping; insane.

10:50 p.m. - took the roll. The name, I presume, was 'Lemondrop'. The guy supposedly swore by them as the best to hit the area in a while. I had rolled once before and recall it as the most peaceful moments in my life (then I came down and felt like shit for a week). I was very psyched about candyflipping. The fractals were off the wall, literally. I was at light speed.

11:45 - my face is flat on the floor. The roll hit me like a Mack Truck and I'm left smiling; saying 'oh my god'. Massages and Vicks Vapor sticks were all around me. Comforting me. LOVING ME. my teeth were not still and I mangled the hell out of a glowstick. The beanbag chair seemed to hug me; love me. Everything was so beautiful. The colors; the faces; even persons I do not like I liked. It was perfect. The CD player didn't work so I took my music to my car and the sonics poured out of the speakers with the intensity of lava. I made statements; regrets; apologies; and intentions to my friends. I loved him. 

We were now nomads. I was treking up a hill when these sudden panic attacks pelted me. I had been through these before (bad trip episodes) and could now handle them very well. I turned away from the fear and searing heat that attempted to take hold. I came again and I raised my hand.  I sat down and stared at the stars as they were smeared across the sky. I felt my feelings being reflected back from them; I felt spectacular. The facts came to me and flowed like a playful brook about my head. I made mindless assumptions which have left me since then. The X was talking. [I talked to my friends about stuff and blah blah blah, the story goes on]

2:05 a.m. - we went back to the cave to meet with MacCleod. We puffed on him and he told of a cat and good days past. I was now uncontrollably laughing and the colors were in a rage. Red, Green, and Purple were shooting everywhere; wrapping around me. I tasted them. It was the taste of color. Take all four tastes: Salt, Sweet, Sour, and Bitter; and then add a fifth, Color. It was creamy and melting, smothering my head with this other candy.

I mistook the glowstick for a lighter and my hand for the bong. The colors were getting in the way as I was shifting from reality to candyland. I saw my hand melt into space-time? am I here. I'm back again and so is MacCleod. Cool; soothing (Note to guys: on drugs or not, put Gold Bond foot powder on your balls. No joke. I am serious. Just a small handful. There is nothing better than pineapple sherbert on your pieces). 'Wait, did I ask you?'.'Where did you come from?', and the story writes itself. My mind has been running to so many places that it is getting tired. It will have to take a break. The couch is very comfortable. 

I wake up. 
Beaten and exhausted.
What he hell had happened?







I am an asthmatic, so I had never tried pot before, although being interested in drugs since I was a child, I had tried mushrooms 3 times before. I was low on cash so I only chipped in for 1/16th of an once, and was not expecting much of a trip. We all ate our mushrooms, put on some music and waited for them to kick in. Many of my friends are heavy pot users, and began to pass a bong around, I am a very infrequent user. I proceeded to smoke for about 20min with them, and was in the middle of complaining about the poor quality of the mushrooms when the table I was looking at started to bend in the middle. I took this as a sign and shutup. In my past experiences with mushrooms, I found a connection to myself that is normally absent, and a lack of fear (social fear). The trip lasted for about 3 hours, and was nothing profound. I attribute this to the amount of pot I smoked. Toward the end of the trip, I became too stoned to finish the hit I was taking at the time and started to freak.!

I was able to calm myself down, but not before looking a little too gone to my friends. Many people smoke pot to aid potency of mushrooms, not I. I do not think I will ever smoke and trip at the same time again, as I was too baked too apreciate the inner connections gained by ingesting mushrooms. I had never even come anywhere close to freaking out before that night, and I suggest to others that they be very carefull with pot and mushrooms.







One Thursday evening, my friend and I obtained some pills, which were called Crown Royals (if anyone else has had an experience like ours, I'd love to see it posted).  Anyway, at 11:00 PM, I ate one tablet, and my friend ate two. An hour later, one more for me, and two more from my friend. As you know, those are pretty high dosages (all in all that night I ate three pills and he ate six).  

It unfolded like regular MDMA, but a very intense roll with some strange but subtle visuals.  After eating another pill, we went outside around 5 am to look at everything and chill out.  Well, we were staring across a field as the sun started to rise, and at that point I began one of the most beautiful and strange trips of my life.  I was staring at the huge pine trees lining the far-off horizon, and to my amazement, I was back in the mid-1800's. The 'trees' were actually Confederate soldiers marching in the distance - I could actually make out their legs marching and their buttons gleaming in the morning light.  Stunned, I turned to my friend and asked him if he saw the soldiers. He turned and stared at me, and confirmed that he too had the same vision.  This was only a hint of things to come.

At that point, it was about 6:30, and the sun had about risen, so we traveled to our local duck pond to check out the atmosphere.  Upon arriving, we were greeted by small ducklings waddling about the sand surrounding the lake. Of course, we both realized that these were not ducklings, but actually very tiny camels traversing their confined desert existence.  The lake itself was heaven on Earth.

The new sunlight filtered through the steam rising from the lake, radiating on us.  As I stared at the pristine fairy-taleness of it, I realized that this was the home of the Lady of the Lake.  In the middle of the pond was a small island swarming with exotic greeness and life.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something on the water.  Apparently a giant silver beach ball, it was swept gently by the breeze into view, slowly driting perpendicular across my field of vision and reflecting the sunlight into a thousand directions, like some ancient and beatiful alien artifact that landed in the lake.  These visions were certainly the most beatiful and astounding things I have witnessed, and are a favorite story of mine to tell.  After that, we procedeed to the library to await the opening and maybe take a little reading in.  

Well, directly across from the library exists our town cemetary.  And, of course, we decided to pay it a visit.  We made a slow beeline towards the centerpiece of the cemetary, which was a 10-foot-tall, larger than life crucifix with a stone-carved Jesus hanging reluctantly from it.  Being careful not to disturb the spirits, we ended up in front of the crucifix, and we both stared at Jesus...  who, to our sublime delight and horror, proceeded to literally turn his head, open his eyes and look at us.  His mouth opened as if to speak, when my friend blurted out, 'I'm sorry!', and ran about thirty feet away.  I just stood and gaped at the hallucinations we were having.  That's about the end of the trip.  We soon thereafter went to bed for a *long* time.  Many other strange and exiciting things happened during that trip.  

We both had fully lucid dissociative experiences, where we completely knew who each other was and what time it was and what we were doing, but we were sitting outside his house and freaked out because we could not figure out *where we were* for the life of us.  My friend just said 'Hey man, where are we?' when I realized that everything was the same, but completely unrecognizable to us.  We also found ourselves frequently forgetting things that happened seconds ago.  To quantify this, we often play the band name game, where you name bands alphabetically back and forth, repeating all the bands that were said beforehand.  I think we got through Anthrax, the Beastie Boys, and Candlebox before we both looked at each other strangley because we forgot what we were doing.  We visited a McDonald's, and after we placed our order, found ourselves confused as to what we were doing there and why we were giving people with the funny hats our money.

Needless to say, I've had similar experiences with Superman pills.  Three of those over the course of a night led me to a Jurassic Park in my friend's backyard, where I experienced the most vivid hallucinations of 30-feet tall, roughed-skin dinosaurs lumbering and playing in the forest.  Not to get into detail, but I also visited Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum's cottage in Wonderland.  Keep in mind that these were not CEV's, but fully waking and believable transmogrifications of reality into whatever my mind projected it to be.  If anyone runs or has run into the higher dosages of these pills, let's hear from you.  I have not matched the intensity and reality of these hallunications with mushrooms, acid, DMT, or any other hallucinogen.  It was totally unique and totally mind-blowing.  I wonder what those chemicals were...







I had taken E pills before and I had enjoyed every experience thus far.  I'm not really into doing any other types of drugs.  I have tried magic mushrooms before and did not like the tripping experience, but I loved the feeling ecstasy gave me.

I had a group of 3 friends that I usually took the pills with and we also had a usual person that we got them from.  This time a person that one of us knew said that he knew someone who had really good E pills and they were only $20 as opposed to the normal $30 we payed.  I was excited about these pills until I saw them.

They were not in the usual circular shape with a picture on one side of them.  They were crushed in a capsule.  The guy that we go them from said it was normal and the pills were just crused.  I did not have a bad experience yet so we all took them.

The first one of us to feel it didn't act normally how people would act on E, we had a really trippy feeling, but was comfortable with it, my other 2 friends had a really dopey and slow feeling, but nothing like E.  None of them had it worse than me though.  

It first hit me and I felt a little nausea and disoriented, but fought off the throwing up feeling.  All of a sudden one of my palms started to itch really badly and it turned red and stared to burn.  I asked one of my friends to get me some ice to cool it down and he looked at me and told me I had a rash all over my face.  I went to the bathroom to only notice that he was right and the rash was all over my body!  At this point my palm that itched swelled incredibly and the other started to itch.  I threw up and started to drink some water.  I didn't feel very ill after that but the rash continued to bother me and my palms really stared to hurt.

I can't remember how long this lasted but I didn't want to be around anyone.  I camped out in the bathroom and just wanted to be alone.  This was nothing like E and I was really disappointed.  Finally the rash went away and the swelling in my hands went down and I joined everyone else.  At this point it felt a little trippy, kinda like I was really drunk.  

Finally, hours later, this all went away.  I do not know what was in those pills, and as far as I know I am not allegic to anything.  I just wanted to warn people not to pull a stupid move like I did and trust someone that I really did not know and didn't even use the stuff.

As much as the pills sound like a good deal, don't let this happen to you.















Well, I had read several accounts of extractions of MG seeds, and happened to go with the polar/nonpolar method.  Materials used include Naptha and 9 packets of 'Flying Saucer' MG seeds from Home Depot, as well as a bottle of nearly 100 proof Bombay Sapphire gin from Costco.  Upon opening the seed packets, I noticed that most of them were tan, with the exception of a few black ones.  I had read from previous accounts that the black ones were more potent, but anyway...

I ground up the seeds in my grinder, and then dumped them into a jar, and in went the Naptha...oh, about 300 or 400ml.  Shook the hell out of it for about 30 min or so, and then strained the resultant mixture through a #4 coffee filter...gotta open that window, or you'll get a major headache from the petroleum distillates.  Since the resultant mush still smelled like petroleum, I aired it out overnight, and in the morning...no more smell.  I then added about 2 oz worth of Bombay Sapphire to the mush, dumped it into one of those 1/2 pint Bell canning jars, and intermittently shook it for the next 1.5 days.  Finally, the day of reckoning...I filtered the resultant mess through 2 coffee filters (so damn slow unless you have a vacuum setup because the mush impedes the flow), yielding 2 shots worth of tan-looking Bombay Sapphire gin.  My wifey and me looked at each other, smelled the mixture- kind of like gin- and reading reports that we should hold the mix in our mouths to aid in mucous membrane absorption, said bottoms up---blech!  I nearly choked on the mixture...it burned ALOT more than straight gin, and could only hold the mix for about 30 secs before swallowing.  For the next 2 hours, the back of my throat burned like crazy, and despite the whole processing, I felt vaguely nauseous as well.  

As for the trip...well, let's just say that 4.5 packs worth of MG seeds didn't quite do the trick.  Very vague visuals if we stared at the granite on our countertops...the patterns moved a bit, but nothing major.  Colors were enhanced, and we both had the giggles.  I was feeling a bit randy, but nothing like the 'I've gotta meld my groin into yours' feeling that I get somewhere along my acid trips.  Also, the much of the day, we were both extremely lazy, VERY relaxed, and felt like we could just melt into our sofas.  

We spent the day (we started around 11am) lying around, watching TV, taking a walk (we did a lot of smiling, but people didn't seem odd to us, and we never felt that paranoia which sometimes occurs when you are on acid in public) around the park, and marvelling at the beauty of nature.  The trip, which was mild at best, was mostly on our mental outlook on life and our environment, but no overt visuals, no auditory hallucinations.  In a sense, it almost felt like getting buzzed on some good cannabis like Durban Poison which knocked you back a couple of rows deep.  Two things- perhaps the equivalent of 6 grams of MG seeds were not enough, and we should have gotten 9 packs each (the seeds were Burpee), or perhaps Flying Saucers were not the variety to get- could anyone comment on the relative strengths of other types, such as Heavenly Blue.  All in all, pleasant enough, but given the trouble it took to prepare it, not to mention the cost (heck, 2 tabs of acid is $10 max here in SF), I doubt I'll try it again.









Since coming off the Pill, I had the most painful periods  - great big cramps. I have Valerian growing wild in my backyard, so I simply ate a small green leaf every two hours. The leaf took about an hour to take effect, and almost completely removed the cramps, and another leaf lightly chewed (tastes awful!) every two hours kept the cramps at bay for the next 8 hours. Side effects: made me a bit lethargic, and I went to bed early and slept very deeply.

Verdict: worked just as well as conventional anti-inflammatories! Highly recommended, though probably best to avoid alcohol or driving while taking it.








My boyfriend and I took about 10 grams of Nutmeg in fresh powdered form at about 6pm one Friday night.  We just mixed it up with some coke and attempted to drink it.  It really doesn't taste bad at all!  Just that its like trying to swallow sand!  It is really tricky to swallow, but you get over it 1/2 way through and just deal with it.

It wasn't until about 9:30 pm that it kicked in, just as we were waiting for a train into the city for a night out.

We started off with the strange feeling we get when we smoke pot, like something's happening, but not (!?!?)  Its not physical or mental, but something's happening somewhere. Anyway, shortly following, our pulses really started to race and we got very sweaty.  We stared at lights which looked much brighter and prettier than usual.  We stared a lot, but barely talked.  The train ride became more and more thrilling as the minutes passed.  It seemed to go faster and faster, then seemed as if it were going down into the centre of the earth!!  Our sense of direction was pretty warped at this stage, yet we were perfectly capable of speech and movement without looking suspicious.

Some time later, maybe 1/2 hour, we were in a friend's car in the back seat looking up at the tall buildings against the night sky.  Our sense of reality was again a little warped and it seemed that the whole city was just floating in space...like a space ship or something. Even at the time it seemed ridiculous but still very possible (the same thing happens to us when we're stoned).

At about 12 midnight we each had about another 10 grams and got significantly worse after that.  I found that standing up and being still were very difficult, I'd stumble and trip over a lot.  I'd shuffle about and talk very very slowly, but wouldn't shut up (!) like when I'm completely drunk or I guess really really stoned!

The night went on and I was so out of it!  I could barely move I was so heavy and tired and just brain dead I think!! I enjoyed food, and found things tasted really different.  I began to talk some really weird shit at this point, like saying that my slice of pizza tasted like a maze in a maze book I had when I was a kid - really stupid stuff, but I meant it all! The taste of the pizza really did remind me of that maze book!

Anyway, as it got to about 6am, on the train ride back home, I felt as if I were asleep, or in a dream, but I wasn't asleep! Walking home from the station seemed very surreal also!

Unfortunately the next day I slept in until about 4pm and felt pretty lazy for most of the next day also, but it was worth it for an interesting experience!!  I'd recommend it, just keep an open mind!







I've tried Ketamine powder cooked down with B12 before (known locally as 'Super K'), which seems to cause a weird sort of super-effect and disassociation from the K experience itself - the K hits you stronger than it normally would, but when you pay attention to its effects it kind of feels as if you're remembering what they're like as opposed to feeling them in real time. I'd been told that this was because Ket affected the same receptors that B12 did, although whether or not that's true I don't know. At any rate, I got ahold of some injectable (IM) B12 along with a good supply of liquid Ket, so last night I decided to see what would happen if I combined them intra-muscularly:

Injected half into my left shoulder first, as I got to my right shoulder for the second half it started kicking in. The initial rise was a lot more intense, right off the bat, than without the B12 - the 'buzz' in my hearing was getting loud, quick, and my entire body started vibrating way more than it ever had before. I had trouble even getting the second dose in, as my hand was shaking so badly I was having trouble with the plunger. I got it in before it was too strong, though, and laid back. The rush kept coming, but was gaining in both volume and overall intensity way beyond the onset of any other K-trip. The last thought in my mind as I was approaching K-Land was 'Shit, I guess I shouldn't have done this...hope I don't die.' I would have chuckled but I was cut off.

Click - extremely brief blackout (as usual at this point), and blam - in K-Land. Sorta. I was in the 'tunnel stage', being dragged this way and that through the strange, 4th dimensional space I've come to love, only everything was much clearer - the visuals were crisper, feelings of motion much stronger. There was something else amiss, although at this point I was way too overwhelmed to know what (I'm comfortable, and familiar, with K-Land; this was different enough that it was like doing K for the first time all over again).

The tunneling continued for a normal amount of time, except rather than just suddenly realizing I had my ego back, I could sense it coming on slowly. For the first time ever, I remember feeling my lips speak some strange sounds/words while I was still travelling through the tunnels. I wish I could remember some of the things I said and when I said them - I was making weird sounds/speaking in tongues in response to specific events happening to me in K-Land, as if some part of me was identifying with (or responding to) them.

The most noteworthy part of this slow-yet-noted regaining of my ego was that I remembered who I was way before I normally would (I was at the tail-end of the tunnel stage, but still in it), and at this point realized what I had felt was amiss the whole time - the entire experience felt like I was watching a very good movie, absorbed by it and blanking out everything else, rather than fully absorbed and unaware of any 'other reality' like it is when just doing K by itself. As soon as I realized this, I decided to try and focus my concentration back to my body - and found that I could do it, although it was difficult to maintain.

Something about this made me think, 'Hmm...maybe if I focus my mind specifically *away* from my body, I can have a 'true' out-of-body experience.' This had been my plan for every other K-trip I'd ever been on, although the lack of ego and abrupt shift from egoless to self-identity status on my other K-trips had always killed the plan. So, this time I tried it - I let myself slip back into the now-fading tunnel state, but somehow (???) focused my attention away and up, to a point I believed was somewhere near my ceiling. I felt a wierd shifting, off from the direction the tunnels were pulling me and sort of towards the ceiling, but almost as soon as it started it subsided again, and I realized that I was now completely out of the tunnel state and to the post-K-Land, self-realized-but-still-really-screwed-up phase. Too bad; if only I'd figured it out a little sooner, I think I would have succeeded.

The rest of the trip was familiar territory, nothing special. The only noteworthy thing is that rather than going right to sleep like I normally would, I instead got up and went to the bathroom. I think it was from the B12 energizing me, as I had been real tired before I'd taken the K. Urinating was the most difficult thing I think I'd ever done, must have taken me a couple minutes just to figure out which muscles made it 'work.' I looked in the mirror as well, and had a difficult time recognizing me. Not just from the 'Frame-O-Vision' effect of the K, but also because I looked as alive as a corpse, all waxy, pale and disheveled. I chuckled at this, went back to bed, and fell asleep. (As a side-note, although I felt pretty queasy walking around, I didn't feel at all like I was going to throw up. A benefit of injecting over drinking or snorting K, I guess)

This morning my entire arms are sore, something that's never happened before (it is normally just the area right around the injection), and I took some asprin for a headache I could tell I was going to have when the K fully wore off. It's 11 AM now, about 9 hours since I took the K, and I still have threshold effects, and my body is more worn out than after a normal Ketamine 100-150mg IM dose.

To sum it up, the B12 seemed to intensify the trip a good deal, as well as make it easier to remember. Although I didn't get a whole lot out of it this time, I'm sure once I get used to it I'll be able to start examining the experience better/get more out of it (as I've begun doing on regular K-trips). My only concern is that combining the B12 and Ketamine is really hard on my body - the little voice in the back of my head keeps warning me not to do this very often. Other than that, I suggest this (having no medical knowledge to back up if it's at all a sane thing to do) as something for serious Ketters to try.









I trip sporadically-from every day spanning a week to once every couple months- each time taking in excess of 3 hits.  I usually trip with at least one other person.  My experiences transpire generally with my peers who have dosed smaller amounts than I (e.g. they eat 1-2 tabs while I eat 3-7) and I am much less affected by the drug.  My trips range from no effect at all to a felling of euphoria and/or anxiety accompanied by a most entertaining and subversive train of thought.  Last time I tripped I took 3 hits and my girlfriend took 1 and my trip lasted about an hour and a half.

I experienced no visual hallucinations, just a heightened perception of beauty in everything around me, and the usual unsusual and insightful train of thought.  I felt high and happy with no ill effects (I have never experienced any ill effects besides a sore neck probobly from looking around so much).  My girlfriend on the other hand had a very intense trip lasting about 10 hours.  We both took the same acid, and we both smoked the same amount of pot.  The pot seems to have little or no effect on my friends and I while we are tripping.  My girlfriend had finally come down around 5 in the morning and she wanted to smoke some pot.  I used the lavatory, noticed my pupils were no longer dialated and returned to pack up a bong.  We smoked about 3 grams of pot and then my girlfriend freaked out and started crying saying that she was still not finished tripping, but then she came to her senses and began to laugh, thinking that the pot had caused this to occour. (is this possible?) I went to look and sure enough my pupils had widened, but I felt no different.  

On a seperate occasion I took 5 doses of lsd and felt nothing but a bout of hot flashes and anxiety.  My pupils never dialated but I did feel dosed.  All effects stopped thereafter and my peers who had taken only 1 hit of acid were bouncing off the walls and they ended up having an 8 hour trip. I ended up going to sleep about 2 and a half hours after consuming the 5 sugar cubes.  

I have done a bit of searching and cannot find any explanation behind a tolerance to lsd besides dormant or active pschotic disorders.  I am pretty sure I have no psychotic disorder but I have been told I need to be checked for ADD.  I would like to find out any correlations between tolerance and biological/psychological make up.  I smoke pot every day and meditate occasionally.  If any of you guys has any info on this subject I would be happy to hear it.







i used to use coke, socially, at first. a friend and i would get some blow on the weekends and spend our time drinking and doing lines. i remember the euphoria. it made me feel powerful, beautiful, and i secretly enjoyed the 
ritual preparation of cutting lines. most of my friends used and it was relatively accepted in our group. 

i started using in my late teens, but as i matured and began to question who i was and why i do the things i do i began to feel very guilty about my coke use. i realised that the person i wanted to become didn't include the use of drugs and alcohol. 

at about this time the friend i was using with was using way more frequently and a whole lot more. all the basic signs of addiction were apparant. she began hanging out with other people. i decided that if i were to stop i'd need to stop hanging with her. but my use didn't end at that. although i didn't see her anymore i still had a hard time saying no to offers when i was drinking in bars. addiction? habit? caught it in time? i don't know. all i know is i liked the high, but i had to stop. 

i haven't used in almost two years. i'm now dating a crack addict! ironic or what! it's a painful ride, but now i know how my ex was feeling when i was using. it's a sick habit that lies to you. it makes you believe you're invinsable. the only reason i think it affected me as it did is a lack of self-esteem. now i'm clearer in my thinking and of who i am. i feel better about myself(that took work) and this drug doesn't fit into my life anymore. to all of you out there who continue to use... the answer lies within you not within the dope.







The only thing that I had really ever tried before was Marijuana. I had tried it 2 times with really close friends of mine. I knew that I could trust them.

It was a Saturday night and me and my 2 friends were sitting around waiting for my friend's parents to go to sleep. They finally did at about 11:30 pm. My two friends pulled out some 5 white tablets with horseshoes on them. I had always thought of myself as the kind of kid who doesnt do bad stuff, and at the time I considered X bad stuff. They each took a tablet and looked to me. I had originally decided that I wouldn't take one, but i would just watch them. Well, I gave in and took my first one. As soon as I swallowed it I kind of regretted it. My friend, Mike, started acting weird after about thirty minutes. I didn't understand it. He just layed on the couch and kept stretching. He said it was an awsome experience. About 45 min after we had taken the pills, My other friend, Alex, started getting really hyper. He started running around the room jumping on couches and shit. I thought he was freaking out, but he said it felt good. 

They told me to start jogging in place and that would get the roll going, so I did and damn did it kick in. I looked around for a second and everything was different. Not really different colors or shapes, but I had achieved a different mind set. I ran over to a map of Europe on the wall. I kept talking about how that map was of the world and Napoleon was after me(I don't know why the fuck that happened). I then shot a quick glance over to my friend Mike. I kept calling him Napoleon and told him I was going to kill him (Emotional side of me). My friend alex told me he was Michael and I was relieved. I gave both my friends a hug. 

The next hour or so was kind of blurry. I just remember felling really scared for what seemed like about thirty seconds, but I was told it was around 20 minutes. It was one of those feelings that you get when you were lost when you were a little kid. My friends took me outside to show me, I swear the best experience ever, how laying in the grass felt. I took off my shirt in about 38 degree F weather. I was still warm to me. I layed face up in the grass with my bare back sitting on the grass. They told me it was too cold outside so they layed a blanket on me. I layed there for about 30 min and then got a sudden burst of energy. I got up and sprinted as fast as I could up and down the street until my body shut down. I fell and skidded on the concrete, got back up with no pain and started running again. I decided that it was time to go back inside. As we were going back inside, I looked up at the sky, it was orange (it really was in reality). I couldn't believe how it could be like that and all of the sudden my eyes rolled back in my head. I was told if this happened just close my eyes so they don't dry out. 

I stood there with my eyes closed and my eyes were still rolling back in my head for about 30 minutes. When they came back down, I couldn't find my friends. I called for them in a whisper and i found them, they were packing a pipe of weed. I told them I wanted some. We smoked a coulple bowls(bad idea). Unless you smoke a lot of weed don't smoke it at all with X. I went back inside, the weed had brought the roll down a little, but I was still feeling awsome. For the last couple hours I just talked about my feelings and some philosophical shit with them. I am so glad that my friends introduced me to X. It is the best stuff I have tried so far. Always remember, have your closest friends with you. Have experienced people with you, they make the roll better. Drink water in moderation. Don't fight your ambitions unless it is detremental to your health or others. 

I would like to thank Michael and Alex, my best friends.















Well, the experiment was an absolute success.  The LSA alkaloids did do as advertised.  However, I still find it to be a better idea to go and purchase LSD-25.  The fact of the matter is that the materials are about twice as expensive as the LSD-25 ($9.00), a tenth as potent, nausea isn't a problem with LSD-25, and it (LSD-25) doesn't require preperation.  But, the LSA alkaloids do produce LSD like effects with some intresting additions to that; i.e., tiredness, lethargy, nausea, slightly increased physical stimululation in comparison to LSD-25 (can be attributed to other alkaloids present in seed material), visual stimulation(hallucinations) to a lesser degree than LSD-25, 'afterglow' is quite pronounced (greater day after effects than LSD-25).

LSA EXPERIMENT: 
13.5g Morning Glory 'Heavenly Blue'  Seed Material

01:55 AM EST:  Seed material strained into 12oz. glass using fine screened metal strainer.  Resulting in thick seed pulp-like material in strainer and a heterogeneous mixture of seed and water inside the glass.

02:05 AM EST:  Liquid material refridgerated (approx. 30 degrees F.).

02:15 AM EST:  Half of the liquid material consumed .

02:20 AM EST:  Approx. 1 gram of marijuana smoked to ease the nausea. 

02:25 AM EST:  Remainder of liquid material consumed.

02:28 AM EST:  Vomited

02:31 AM EST:  Very slight LSD-25 like onset symptoms. 

02:45 AM EST:  Pulp-like seed material consumed on toasted pumpernickle with butter.

02:51 AM EST:  Intensity of LSD-25 like onset symptoms increased.

03:45 AM EST:  Approx. time of LSA trip peak.

04:46 AM EST:  Mild trip(equivalent: 1 good paper dose of LSD-25), very physical trip(numbness & tingling of limbs and body), Head is suprisingly 'clear'(thought and articulation of sentances), visuals, audio is only lightly affected, slight nausea is present.







Upon arrival in Canada from Scotland, I was soon invited to try some lovely B.C weed going by the name of White Widow. The stuff was covered in sticky, white THC chrystals and was like nothing I had ever seen before. Having only smoked low-stength resin back home, I was well up for it as were my buddies. The smell was very pungent but very nice. 

As soon as we lit up, we could feel the good times roll. After a few strong puffs, we were all absolutely f**ked. My English friend thought he was an explorer and started to swim accross the front lawn. Needless to say, the hilarity sent us into huge fits of uncontrollable laughter. Then, when it eventually subsided a little, I honestly started to believe I was a monkey. I sped around the room like monkeys do making the kind of noises monkeys do. We thought it was hilarious although one of my friends wasn't quite so impressed when I ate all the bananas out his cupboard but hey, I had the serious munchies.

After we all calmed down, we got down to some serious munching accompanied by some quality music. The visuals and sonics were amazing. Trip Hop was invented for this drug.

I don't know if we were smoking extra strong stuff or it was just because we were new to strong weed but this has to be the single best drug experience if my life.









I had tried mushrooms 2 times before and had nothing but great experiences on it. But this trip would turn out to be not so enjoyable. Me and 2 of my friends decided that it would be a good idea to celebrate the turning of the new millenium with a good mushroom trip. We had all tripped together before so I was comftorable just sitting at home tripping with 2 of my close buds. So anyway we wanted to peak right around mid-night so we figured we should eat them around 11:00. My friend didnt really feel like eating the shrooms so he decided he would make some tea, while me and my other friend would chew them up. We each took around 2.0 grams and had kinda of a lot of tea left over (we ended up sharing this through the rest of the night.)

Within 20 minutes we were already feeling the effects, I immediatly began to see slight visuals. I still felt a little nauseous from the taste of the mushrooms, so we smoked a bowl. It calmed my stomach right away, and I could tell that I was really going to enjoy this trip. The hallucinations were constant now and I had a feeling of being at total peace. Me and my friends just layed in the living room staring at the ceiling for what seemed like an hour. In actuallity it was only around 11:40, the new millenium was approaching! But I just layed there taking in everything that these mushrooms had to offer. The feeling was incredable! I was taking very deep breathes just trying to comprehend all that I was seeing and feeling.

It had just turned 12 and the trip suddenly turned from a visual experience to a mental experience. We sat there talking for a while when I began to feel really overwhelmed by what I was feeling. My mind started to race faster than it ever had before, and I began feeling a little uncomfortable. I had some weed so we decided we should pack a bowl. I was so out of it that I couldn't even handle packing the bowl, I had no choice but to let my friend pack it. We smoked it but unfortunately it didnt help. The thoughts in my head were uncontrollable, I had this urge to just walk out of the room and go to bed. My 2 friends were enjoying there trip, they were 'bonding' much I like I had done in my previous trips, but I felt somewhat left out. I now HATED being there. I just wanted to go to sleep, but my mind was racing way too fast.

By now it was around 1:30am. At around 2:00am my friends sister showed up with about 15 of her friends, they had just returned from a local New Years Eve party. From here my night just got worse. Everyone sat there celebrating the new millenium, but I was unable to enjoy it all. I just sat there staring off into nowhere thinking how bad I wanted to be at home in my own bed. My mind was in such a state of confusion that I was able to hold a conversation with some one, all of my social skills were gone. So everyone pretty much left me to my self. I just sat there for what seemed like days, wishing I could somehow just go home.

Finally at 4:00 in the morning my mind slowed down enough to where I thought I could go to sleep. So I told my friend (whos house it was) that i wanted to go to bed. They both agreed that was a good idea so we went to bed. I layed there for another 1/2 and hour then finally dozed off.
It's hard to explain exactly how I felt, but I'll just say it wasn't an enjoyable occurance. Actually now that I look back at it, it was probably the worst day of my life. I always told my self that I would never have a bad trip, but I would definately consider this one. Im not done with mushrooms, I just look at the whole thing as a learning experience.
So just a few final words: don't let this story discourage you from using mushrooms, because it's a great mind expanding drug. Just dont rule out the possability of things not going exactly how you had planned.
Have fun, be safe, and remember theres always sweet Mary-Jane!!...420









Ok I'm not an experienced drug user at all.  I'm 19 years old right now, I tried Marijuana when I was about 15 for the first time, and it didn't work.  I tried it 3 or 4 times after that and it still did not work.  So I just gave up on it.  However, this past weekend some was available and so I decided to try one more time.

Now even before I begin to get into this experience, I STRONGLY suggest that you surround yourself with a familiar place and familiar people.  I kept up on the people part, but not the place.  So anyway my friends and I went out into the car, did the deed and by the time we got back to the bowling alley (we were driving while smoking) I started to feel the bottom of my feet tingle and my shins were feeling funny too.  I knew I was finally high, and I was excited and happy at the same time.  I was still sitting in the car when this happened so I didn't even know if I was going to be able to walk.  That's how strange it felt.  But of course I was able to and I made my way into the alley (where all my other friends were) with the largest smile on my face ever.  However, that's where the fun ended.

The alley was loud and smokey as usual, but my senses were magnifying these aspects 10 times as they normally are.  I felt real uncomfortable so I sat down next to the ball return.  Shaking...shaking...that's all my legs kept doing.  Up and down, up and down, and I could not stop them for the life of me.  Then all of a sudden the strangest thing happened and I know none of you will be able to understand it but it's worth mentioning.  As I was sitting there it seemed like the lanes I was at (Axel Lanes), changed into the old alley in which I used to bowl (Clover Lanes).  It seemed like I was at my old Saturday morning league again, and I was seeing old people that I used to bowl with down a couple lanes farther.  It freaked me out, but it was sort of interesting at the same time. I told my friend Kent what was going on and he smiled, probably thinking that I was a moron or something.  But now it was my turn to bowl.

Everything was so complicated now.  Getting off the seat, walking to the ball rack, picking the ball up, looking for the holes in the ball, throwing the thing.  What I used to be so fluid and good at, seemed like it took an eternity to do now.  When I picked the ball up the feel of it amazed me.  It was no longer smooth and round; it had a lot of texture to it (I can't remember what kind of texture but it had some for sure).  I then found the finger holes, which seemed to take an hour or so, but then the strangest thing happened again.  The ball felt like it had oil on it, not just a little, I mean a ton of oil.  So much that I was up there slapping the ball and it felt like the oil was splashing on my shirt.  Just an effect of the drug I thought, so I looked up and every lane to my left and right was totally blacked out, I mean not even visible.  There was nothing there on both sides except black space and then my lane in the middle all lit up. I threw the ball, stood an extra second even after it hit the pins, then when I turned around it felt like I was a nazi or some war figure, with the quick heel turn face forward type of thing (this was probably because I saw the movie 'Apt Pupil' the other day before).  When I faced everybody it felt like the whole attention of the bowling alley was on me, and everyone knew I was high.  This made me uneasy and sort of paranoid.  After that everyone I looked at, I was thinking, 'O man she knows I'm high, or he knows I'm high', I don't know why I even cared but I did.

Well to sum this up, The first time feeling of being high is great no question about it.  I did enjoy being around my friends, but the bowling alley, with so much going on in there, maybe wasn't the best of places to be for the first time. Now I did have this feeling the next couple days of being really stupid, and I couldn't remember short-term memory things (like things that occurred the week before and what not).  However, it went away and was probably just a mind thing.  My only advice to people who are thinking about smoking is to surround yourself with familiar people and familiar surroundings.








Doesn't everyone feel comfortable with themselves?  Do you think that you can discern reality from visions, hallucinations, dreams, and memories?  I hope you can because on dimenhydrinate, I couldn't. 

This has the effect of a very interesting trip.  Even if you think you know its not real, the impression is that it is.  Its like having someone lie to you.  You think you know whats right, but they are right there, talking to you and telling a lie.  

I have gone bowling on dimenhydrinate and have never wondered so much about what really happened.  I was there, but so were twenty other people.  I only went with FIVE other people!  I thought that they were all real.  I was completely functional in my thinking and motor skills, although very tired, but I saw and talked to people that were not there.  

As far as bowling went, I often thought I completly missed, only to find out I had a strike.  Or there was a time when the ball bounced out of my lane and knocked down another person's pins, but it didn't really...  Dimenhydrinate is the most interesting, and scary, drug I have ever seen!  Reality throws you for a loop on this drug.  I don't suggest going out in public with it unless you have a trip sitter, all of the other people that night thought I was going insane except for a friend who has done dimenhydrinate himself.  

Reality and your hallucinations will become one and there is no way to tell them apart because you don't feel 'fucked up'.   I felt perfectly normal, maybe a little bit of dizzyness (along with being very tired).  Be careful on this, your girlfriend is not jumping off of the roof of your house, you don't need to go save her...  But thats another story, now isn't it?  That's just it, it is all one big question on dimenhydrinate.







Well me and my friend were walking home from school and he was telling me about his dad's significant amount of alcohol. He said that when we got there he would challenge me to how many shots we could take. We got there and he said i could choose whatever kind i wanted. I chose a bottle of 80 proof bicardi. He took out some shot glasses and poured the first 2 shots. We tilted our heads back and chugged. That shit was strong! It burned a little and was bitter tasting. 

We decided it was time for round 2. I poured the shots this time. As before, we tilted our heads back and chugged. It was still a little bitter but the burn wasn't as bad. As for the next 2 shots, all that happened was the same, only the bitterness and burn weren't as bad. At this time we felt all dizzy and shit. He poured another round. I leaned back and gulped mine.He had a bit of trouble with his, but he took i like a man. The next 2 shots were pretty intense. We both took them, But we just couldn't handle anymore. 

We filled the bottle with water to make it look like none was missing. I remember seeing everything as a blur, And when i stood up to go sit on the couch,my legs were heavy as hell and i fell down. I crawled to the couch. I had this terrible headache. I sat on the couch and leaned back for a while.I stared at the ceiling and couldn't tell where the fan was. I suddenly felt this surge in my throught. I ran to the bathroom and threw up all in the toilet (i think). Then i crawled over to the couch and just lay there. I was tired as shit so i just fell to sleep. When i woke up, my friends dad wasn't home yet so i woke him up and we cleaned up everything. We still felt dizzy so we decided to go to my house (across the street) to smoke some weed. Thats what i remember.








A friend of mine had been talking a lot about 5-MeO-DiPT, and I was pretty curious about it.  Many of my friends said that it was a tryptamine equivalent of 2-CB, and from the trip reports of 2-CB in PIHKAL I was really anxious to try the 5-meo-dipt.  I went to a party, and was already candyflipping (LSD and MDMA) when I was offered the foxy methoxy.  I was so anxious to try it that I accepted the offer, even though I usually tend to try new drugs by themselves.  

I mixed the 5-MeO-DiPT (it was a fine, white powder) with water and drank it.  About an hour later, I started to feel some effects that were definately NOT due to the LSD or MDMA.  Actually, the best way I can describe it is that the 5-MeO-DiPT overrode the candyflip.  I suddenly just wasn't candyflipping anymore.  There were visuals, but not like those from acid.  Colors were bolder, and objects just outside of my focus (like the wall behind a friend I was talking with) would move and jump, and if I stared at anything for a few minutes it would start to slowly move and pulsate.  My body temperature started to rise really rapidly, so much so that shorts and a rayon T-shirt was unbearably hot.  Also, I was feeling much more creative.  

I grabbed a sketch book and started writing what could only be described as fairly weird and demented ramblings.  At the time I was extremely proud of my writings and took them around to show everybody.  Most of that was pretty much besides the point, however.  More than anything, I was HORNY.  I mean WOOHOO was I horny.  It wasn't like the sensualness of MDMA, but more of an all-encompassing libido.  Foxy is definitely a powerful aphrodisiac, at least for me.  Another thing I remembered, the effects would generally come in waves, and dancing for a few minutes never failed to bring about another, stronger wave of the foxy.  

During the comedown, I started to get a really banging headache that really didn't go away for about a day or so.  I assume that the headache was due to dehydration more than the foxy, however.  I definately want to try this again.








  I have managed to experiment with many drugs despite the oppressive drug testing policy of my employer, and am always looking for more.  After discovering information about Salvia as a legal gateway to other worlds, I was skeptical, but after finding it among Erowids Vaults, I was somewhat re-assured, and went about obtaining some for experiments.

  Being overly anxious to try Salvia, and validate its potency, I found myself impatient waiting for my friend to return from the bars tonight.  After surfing the web and infusing myself with knowledge, I decided I could wait no longer, and prepared to try without a sitter.  This is NOT recommended, but things turned out.  I loaded a traditional tobacco pipe with a small amount of cherry tobacco to act as a screen, loaded about 80 mg of Salvia 5X extract on top, and proceeded outside to the porch to eliminate any hazards of dropping the pipe and starting a fire with no-one in the house.  I hyper-ventillated with 3 or 4 deep rapid breaths to allow me to hold the smoke longer, and took one hit from the pipe, saying to myself I hope this isnt bunk.  I held my breath for about a minute, and happily began feeling effects.  It started with pulsating of sound, and mild visual disturbances (the bushes started looking very cool).  I was afraid to smoke more since I didnt have a sitter, so I put the pipe down.

  As I put my hands down on my lap, I could feel them going through my pants, as they had some sort of liquid property.  I resisted the temptation to boost with another hit.  Im sure I didnt get the full 80 mg.  After about five minutes of looking into the street, the effects starting waning, though I still perceived the pulsating sounds, and thought how similar that part of the effect was to my experiences with nitrous.  I wandered inside, fairly unimpaired, and loaded a cylinder of nitrous.  The effects set in very rapidly, with a tingling in my teeth, hands and toes after only 15 seconds.  Closed eye visuals returned.  I kept seeing black and purple, with patterns varying wildly on the periphery and diagonally through the center of my field of vision. In purple was written something I believe to be Lysergic Acid Amide but the whole middle of the phrase was overcome by the patterns.  I am considering LSA from Morning Glory, so it has been implanted in my mind.  The nitrous remained strong for about 5 minutes, and everything was over 20 minutes after first smoking.

  Overall the experience was quite mild, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a legal experience like that.  I cant wait to try a higher dose with a friend.







Febuary 25, 2000

Around 10:30 pm, friday. Salvia 5x extract was smoked, not very much at all, I would say...an average sized bowl between the two of us. We smoked it through a regular pipe - we (bobby and gwynne, a happy couple) were too lazy to make a bong so we just used Bobby's pipe. We were at Bobby's house. His parents were at the movies. This was Gwynne's second Salvia experience. The first experience offered virtually nothing. This was Bobby's fourth or fifth attempt at getting something from Salvia. This time was the first time Bobby experienced anything worthwhile. 

The entire experience lasted less then 15 minutes for both participants. The onset was felt seconds after inhaling. Residual effects lasted no more then 30 minutes.

We did not intend to do salvia as a recreational experience. Both of us believe in a greater spirituality, and would never disrespect any plant. Anyway...

-gwynnes voice-

After I took my first toke, I started to feel a little strange, after my second toke all i remember is...

Reality started to unfold infront of me. I knew I had smoked something, but I do not remember ever exhailing.

In waves, like a rollercoster our/my reality was slashed in half and pulled apart. Reality started to move like a kalidescope (sp?). It was like i was stuck under the kalidescope watching our reality turn and move.

There was a beautiful arrangement of colors that continually twisted in space. As strange as this seems, the colors were made up of thousands of tiny rabbits. The colors I most vividly remember are blue, red and yellow. It felt like i was watching our reality turn and move in this kalidescope motion for about 10 minutes, after which the the colors and the new reality started to slow down and stop moving. Bobby informs me that all this actually took 3 or 4 minutes.

I then found myself looking to my right side at what seemed to me a light bluish/green pale plane.  I immideatly knew that this 'plane' was another reality, another 'world'. To my left, I then saw Bobby.  Realizing he was here, I tried to explain to him that there was another world beside me. The other world was calling me, inviting me to come to it, I did not know however how i would get there. I then suddlenly felt torn. I saw Bobby, and I wanted him to come to this other world with me, however; I knew he was not allowed. I sat there thinking what to do, and trying to explain to Bobby what was happening. I felt a 'presence' from the other world that was 'calling' me to it. Also, whenever I spoke, I heard an almost mocking voice, something/someone repeating every word I said a few seconds after i said them.  This voice was coming from deep within the plane.

Slowly the effects wore off, and things started to go back to normal.  This has been the most powerful substance I have ever done. Yet, i don't feel overly excited to do Salvia again right away. I feel almost frightened by what awaits me the next time I try Salvia. However; I do feel like there is something important i will learn from future expierances.

-bobby's voice-

>From what I can remember....

Upon closing my eyes I reliazed that I understood my alter-ego, my second self. I understood that not only was I really two beings (possibly more), but that I only really appreciate this reality in my normal day to day life. From this experience, I am almost sure that there is atleast one other reality super-imposed on ours. It wasn't a happy or amazing or orgasmic experience, it was just something that showed me that we don't know everything we think we do. The other reality I saw...

I was with two other beings. They had characteristics of people I know, but were not people I know. We were trying to move some object, and because of this strange time-shift, my other self in the other reality was unable to function. The object we were trying to move at that point began to turn into a large spike that was stabbing me in the face. It sounds harsh, but it wasn't painful, just annoying. At this point I began to try to explain this to Gwynne, but then it all folded in on itself and disapeared. I tried to lay quietly for a bit, with my head in the covers, but once I had thought about it...it was too late. Then, stardetdly, I heard the sound of Gwynne saying to me: 'Are you okay?'.

I got up and went over to the other room, where Gwynne was sitting. She hadn't said anything. From that point on it just kinda felt like my other Salvia experiences. I was hot, sweaty, etc, with a large pressure being forced on my body. Then she got off the computer and I begin writing this. When I began writing, I was still very high, and upon reading the first sentance over, I realize that I wasn't really concious of what I was trying to convey. Now I'm almost fully back to normal.

I do not claim that this has any spiritual or actual significance. It seems to me like only a tease as to what I can really learn...I know that this other reality was probably just a part of my own mind, but I would never brush it off as just that, as that would stop me from learning all I can from it.


Our advice: go smoke some Salvia now! And you'd better respect it.







I had heard about Dramamine from a couple of my friends.  One who had tried it and one who hadn't.  So we said what the hell and gave it a shot.  One night we went and acquired some of this wonder pill and set out for our trip.  That night we took about 8 pills to start off and some Two-ways (Ephedrine) to keep us perky throughout.  Well...about a half hour into it and I just got this rush over me.  It was hard to move and I couldn't really concentrate on too much.  I would want to move but it would seem so hard I would give up.  Then all of a sudden I was fine...like it was over so i got disappointed and took 12 more.  

Time passed on and on and on and I started to feel the way I did before but not as intensely.  I'm not exactly sure when it happened, but after one of my friends had left, he came back and stood before me talking to me (He wasn't really there though) I began to answer back to him and my other friend was wondering who I was talking to.  I then turned back to my friend that wasn't there and he was indeed not there any longer.  So I just smiled, because that's what I do when I realize the drug I'm on is working.  

My friend and I soon began laughing hysterically because we couldn't keep a conversation going in one direction.  Nor could we remember what we were talking about when we needed to clarify something.  I would think of what I wanted to say and it would be there when I said it.  It was like the whole thought itself came out when I talked and I would forget what I said right after I said it.  Time passed on and a bunch of failed conversations and friends who weren't really there instances later, we decided that it was done and we decided to call it a night.  Damn was I ever wrong.  I woke up and it was still dark out.  There were so many people in the house.  They were all my friends too.  It didn't occur to me at the time that everything that happens from here on out wasn't real.  All of my friends were really mad at me.  I had no idea what I had done wrong.  They were yelling and threatening to beat me up and they kicked me out.  So I went outside to get away from it all.  It was cold out but I didn't really notice it (Or I just didn't care) I walked around the yard trying to figure out what had gone wrong to make them want to do those things to me.  

As I was walking around, I would see them outside and I would hide to do my best to avoid them at all costs.  I was really scared.  I went out to the driveway and stood there, watching everything that happened, I saw a moving truck behind the trailer with all my stuff being thrown into it.  I saw my friends move in and out of the bushes and jump around in the trees like it was nothing.  Like no human could possibly do.  I saw my friends come and go (None of whom really came or went).  

(This really happened) My roommates ride for work showed up and asked me why I was outside so early in the morning and I told her that she would find out. My roommate walked out but I assume he didn't see me and they drove off.  After he left, I decided to go bake inside since I figured everyone should be gone and I could get some sleep before they came back.  I wake up, still thinking I got kicked out, and I call my dad telling him I had a big problem and I really needed to talk to him.  That whole time I was pacing back and forth trying to figure out what I was going to do.  My friend woke up later on that morning and I told him about what happend.  He just laughed and told me that it couldn't have happened.  After much thought and deliberation on my part I realized that none of it was real.

It didn't occur to me at the time that no one could do what they were doing, a moving truck couldn't fit behind the house, and that there were no cars in the driveway for all these people to be here.  So I started laughing myself.  Then the phone rang.  It was my dad wondering what had happened that was so important.  I had no idea what to tell him.  So I told him I had had one of those dreams again.  He knows about them.  I have dreams that appear very real every so often.  Not as real as this Dramamine induced one though. Not nearly as real feeling.  I've done Dramamine one other time and I pretty much did the same thing as far as talking to people that weren't there, living expieriences that weren't really going on, etc. 







I had settled down one Friday evening in January and had planned on doing some traveling thru my mind. I ingested a tab of E and waited for effects to come on. maybe I was impatient or the E wasnt as good as I wanted it to be. Anyhow, I ended up swallowing 2 more tabs, which isnt for everybody, but im a big guy 6'6 and 240 pounds and I like E. By the way that was about 1.5 hrs. after I took the first pill. Next thing was to snuff up that special K ( about an eighth of a gram ). At the time I had been watching a movie I had rented (RUN LOLA RUN- kick ass movie I might add). Effects of both E & K were kicking in real good at this time and I seemed to be in this movie! I made it thru the movie(barely) with out going into the K WHOLE. I put on the radio and and snuffed another eighth of K. My consciousness completely melted out of time and blended into everythingness and nothingness. I think at this time I nodded out for bit- I wuz really high,low,in,out,and everywhere & nowhere,in other words INEFFABLEY FLIPPIN ! 

The effects yielded enough to bring me back to partial consciousness. I had thought that everything was alright and then the other wanted to show me more. Time at this point had entered back into my consciousness but it was like some sort of Quantum Time. Time in packets of data moving thru my whole being in waves of an unspeakable energy. At this point ihad the feeling that everything in my life (down to the smallest insignificant happenings) had led to this moment. The intensity of the energy was steadily increasing and luminescence now entered the happening. All of this increased to unimaginable proportions-similar to that point on a great rollercoaster ride when you think you just cant take any more, but infinitely, extremely, Godpower-INFINERGY. Next everything was alive - my room, stereo, computer, pictures, bed, and me!  this INFINERGY continued thru me and everything -then started expotentiating time into those packets which grew like crystals all over everthing. the crystals struck some kind of paranoia in me, as if I had some how changed reality as we generally know it. I thought maybe I caused a riff in space time--that every agency that would handle somthing like that was outside and on there way to my place. 

The notion that I had started the end of history and the beginning of forever also crossed my mind. I was becoming scared and the other turned up the juice even more and I definitley merged with 'GOD', I was God, for a moment,so I thought! Now forces of even greater power, in my moment of bliss, forces of good, then bad, then indifferent, then altogether worked to put all those crystallized packets of time back where there supposed to be. This did seem to take a little time. Somehow I felt like I had caused some very, very powerful forces to put in some overtime. I feel indebted to them and would like to thank them very much for putting reality back together. The waves of the energy packets were still laced with time as they moved thru my body. I was able to stand up at this point (the walls helped keep me up), as I walked to my bathroom i was coherent but the waves were still flowing thru me. I walked like a robot. different times were at different places in my body! I did worry that this wasnt going to dimminish-and I was going to become a research project. Well if your wondering, it did ware off but I spent all Saturday in bed integrating the experience. I'll end this report with some words of wisdom - It never ends folks-anything & everything that ever was forever will be was first a thought! Unless you know someone or something that knows everything ; ITS ALL MAGIC,AND GOD IS MAGIC BE A H.E.A.D. WERE HERE TO COCREATE!

NOTHING(nothingness) IS PERFECT & FOREVER
Thats my spew -till next time(s)







My first experience with Salvia was with dried leaves. I took 3 big bong hits,held them in as long as I could and leaned back on the couch.I could feel it working.A voice echoed in my head 'He's over the fence.' 'over the fence' 'over the fence' I could see an open can of blue paint with a glob of red paint in the middle. I saw a stick go from the blue straight through the red and back into the blue. This caused the red paint to swirl around on both sides of the stick. It made me think, reality is like the red paint, it's small compared to the things that we're usually not aware of.

Then my concept of time changed. I was back in the 1950's even though I knew I was at home on the couch in the year 2000. It was like not only being at two places at one time but at two times at once. I sat back up, thought about what just happened, and happy not to be a 'hardhead' decided to take 3 more bong hits. This time I felt the feminine presence that I had heared about. She was a lady, showing me the blue (the stuff that isn't) opposite of the red (the stuff that is).I was begining to become aware of cars driving by my house. Everytime one did it caused ripples or swirls in what she was showing me. Soon the sound of cars brought me back to my bedroom. This short experience(30 minutes?)has already taught me to see things in a slightly different light. Just think what one could learn given more time.







This was one fo my first experiences with the drug and by far one of my fondest, if only for the variation in moods and thoughts and how I was able to cope.

The incident happened in 1993 at a MegaDog gig in London.  Similar to a rave but more trancy tribal music and with better visuals.

We (my friend and his girlfriend) had purchased our tickets the day prior to the gig and had spent the rest of the time what gear to take and use.  George (as he shall be called) had already gone to Amsterdam and obtained a thousand 'groucho marx' (rectangular tabs) and was hiding them from his mum in his computer.

A few hours before entrance we had gone to a couple of pubs and had some alchohol (I've never seen too much of a hazard of mixing small amounts of drink with other drugs) and managed to have ourselves a bit of a smoke.  I had to smoke via a pipe coz I can't stand tobacco so I'm Mr Neat.  George prefers Skunk so Skunk it was.  

By the time we arrived at the que for the gig we were feeling mellow but happily nervous with anticipation.  We didn't even take much heed to the intensity of the cold of the night (November).

After the obligatory hands-up-search-for-anything type affair at the door and then sorting coats and tickets out we all went off to check out the venue.  We'd been there before but its always the thing to do.  The music was already thumping from various rooms and there was the feeling of adrenalin in the air.  The main arena was warming up with the likes of Astralasia with deep base sounds that reverberated around the walls and straight through you.  That was good in itself.

Soon afterwards we met up again and decided that we would take just half of a trip for now.  Because half was the size of a normal one I knew at some point I was going to come up pretty hard.  One by one we filed off to the loos and dropped our gear.  

I ALWAYS have a nauseous feeling when I swallow the tab.  I think its due to the anticipated nausea that some of us get when coming up.  So after swallowing I did the innevitable body shiver with a screwed up face and went to the bar to get some water.

The next forty five minutes or so we spent leaning against the wall nodding our heads to the music and occasionally taking swigs of water.  We all do it!  I think I was the last to come up and when that happens you automatically think you've got a dud.  But low and behold I remember the first twinge of slight sickness.  It made me shift my position and then I felt the warm sensation in my stomach.  this made me breath in deep and I felt my cheeks redden.  Loverly!  The smile stretched across my face and I just let it take control.

It came in waves and eventually remained a constant.  My weight was lifted and I felt light as a feather.  Goose bumps flittered up and down my arms as I felt the steady thump of the base pulsating through my body.  Ten minutes later and I couldn't resist the urge to dance and I was off!  Eventually I was at the front of the crowd near the speakers and the stage where the djs were and loving it.

Every now and then I would come off for a breather.  Sometimes I found George and his girlfriend sitting down with huge grins on their faces.  We would exchange slow nods and smiles (all that's needed) and do our own thing.  I remember that when I danced my arms and hands seemed to move in a slow motion with my eyes and head following their movement.  It seemed much slower than the music was going but I seemed to be hitting the beat every time.

A couple of hours later and I was absolutely caned - I was sweating buckets and could hardly speak.  I would walk through the crowds as if drifing or floating and the people would just melt out of the way.  There were no sudden movements from me - well of course not, I could predict the entire movements of everyone in the building and new exactly when to turn or glide this way and that.  I was dancing a routine through the crowd that had been pre-written for me - it was fantastic.

The first hallucination I had was when I entered one of the chill out bars.  The very first thing I saw was the stone slabs that they used for the floor.  Then I saw the some grungy people with green army coats in the corner and then a spilt drink to my right.  It was dark here and quite crowded.  In that split second my brain had already made up its mind on where it thought it was.  Quickly the bar melted and revealed the dungeon that I was really in.  I moved slowly through looking at the dripping water and the rats that scurried out of my way.  Prisoners of some other era lay dormant in their green macs in the corners.  The stone walls had green alghi and other damp patches everywhere.  I had to shake my head before the bar materiallised.  'For gods sake' I reminded myself, 'its a fucking bar'.  As I ordered another bottle of water the images kept repeating.  I didn't panic though - it was interesting and I remember thinking how it could happen that anyone could possibly get from a bar to a dungeon cell.

Later I bumped into another friend who was smoking some skunk as he always did.  He seemed able to talk fine and was asking me various polite questions.  Unfortunately,  with every word he spoke I was thinking of a thousand answers and when I eventually opened my mouth to speak, a million words tried to form but ended up in alot of giberish and a few audible 'erms' and 'ums'.  This worried me a little as I was becoming increasingly aware that he could tell I was off my rocker.  I had to control the panic welming inside.  Was he looking at me strangely?  Was he giving subtle hand signals to others to suggest I was stupid? Was the group over there giggling at what I was doing, or wearing - or NOT wearing?  I looked down to check if I my trousers had disappeared.  Again, I had to shake my head.  No-one was taking the piss out of me so calm down!

I met with George who asked if I wanted to up to the balcony to calm down.  I nodded and followed like a zombie.  I passed a couple of people collecting for children in need who collered me for money - I think I gave them a fiver - they knew I was totalled and slapped a sticker on my chest.  I remember they made it cover the face of mona lisa I had printed with fractals and a spliff.  They thought it was funny.  I just wanted to get away from their voices that were changing pitch from high to low and back again.

Upstairs everyone was lying or sitting down.  I had to pick my way through all the bodies and sit down.  We sat for a while and I was able to cool down a bit.  Someone tapped me twice on the shoulder.  I looked round but noone was even near me.  I freaked!  I wasn't bolloxed enough that I couldn't mistake that tap.  And I sure as hell knew that no-one was near me.  'What's up?'  George asked.  'blddysbbbllblbl...um'  I replied in good effort and then pointed to my sticker on my chest.  It had gone!  Oh my god, had the mysterious tapper pinched it or had I imagined those people downstairs?  I hadn't imagined the fiver that was for sure.  Panic was on its way back again. 

I got up and decided to go back for a dance - yeh dancing would get my head back to noddy land.  within a few minutes I was leaping around madly fallowing the green and red fractal designs that my hands were making whilst courting with the flashing lights.

Now, George had warned me previously about some type of Ether that companies were putting into their smoke machine during these times.  He'd said it was like Amyl Nitrite in that it brought everyone up in seconds without them knowing and then they'd have a really ace time and tell all their friends about the gig - thus more gigs.  He also said that it had a habit of multiplying the effects of any substances that you were on by about four times.  Looking back I think it was some urban rumours that were going around - but I still think about it.  Anyway, I remember at one point (when Eat Static were playing) at a crux of a tune the smoke machine let out loads and ingulfed everyone.  In the next few seconds I watched as if not part of my body, as EVERYONE became one moving body.  Their eyes all widened and searching forwards.  it was like a huge wave of bodies all under one control.  Then, all of a sudden I felt my left upper leg lock in intense cramp.  I dropped like a sack of spuds and then really panicked.  No-one had even noticed I was writhing in agony!  If anything, they all seemed to just dance on me.  I picked a direction and crawled through the feet of the possessed crowd until I came to a door.  Stumbling through I was in a corridor and managed to slump myself down on a chair.  

Whilst massaging my leg I remember that my leg was starting to fade in green and red fractals and the floor was alive with sparks of these patterns.  All I could think was 'oh for gods sake not now'  I didn't panic then and was more pissed of that I couldn't benefit the picture because of the cramp.  A girl materialised with a glass of water-'...just as you asked-'  I smiled and wondered when I had asked her.

The pain subsided and I calmed down and I sat back and watched the patterns for a while.  Green and red sparkes were shooting across the floor and all over my hands.  The walls were pulsating and shifting colours and the music was altering its pitch chaotically.  Sitting there I could at last appreciate it for what it was and desperately wanted to work out how it happens.  At that point George came through the door with his girlfriend and they didn't look to pleased.  They asked it I'd noticed the change on the dance floor and George kept on saying about the Ether.  We all agreed to go outside into a square that was part of the building's grounds.  Here we were able to cool down.  I didn't bother speaking but just listend to the whispers of other conversations all around me.  The sound was like the noise of the sea genlty rolling on a shingle beach.

Soon we decided to leave.  I had to be led as I could no longer steer myself in the mathematical fashion I had done before.  I remember walking onto the street and seeing the cars.  The tracers that the cars left behind made it seem as if they were moving at high speed.  Watching them it seemed like they were moving at one mile and hour.  The noise was jingle jangle of squeaks and mumbles.  Getting a cab was the funniest part as neither of us was in any decent enough position to speak properly and we had to enter an office to order it.  It seemed like it took twenty minutes to get the words out and then we were in the car-I was sitting in the front.  

In London the all night cabs are driven by dodgy people with their own cars.  It suddenly dawned on me that we could be taken advantage of here.  None of us would be able to put up a struggle.  I didn't even know where the hell I was let alone put my fists up.  My door was opened and a man started shouting.  This was it, I thought.  We're gonna get mugged and I'm supposed to be the tougher one.  I started laughing.  As it turned out the guy thought our driver was taking his fare.  A few seconds later and we were off.  We stopped under a bridge briefly so that I could be sick out of the car.  George was putting it down to the effects of the Ether - again.

When we got back I got the cramps again and George's girlfriend got me some salt/sugared water which worked a treat (strongly suggest it for dehydration) and I lay there quietly tripping and slowly coming down.

With no sleep, I was up and had left by six thirty in the morning.  I had to travel the underground to Victoria and then down to Brighton (about sixty miles) to work.  Needless to say I was completey plastered and still a little bit tripping.  My boss was not amused.

That's it.  It was, looking back on it a great time and well worth it.  For since then I have been able to work out my own personal dosage and have developed a good understanding of hallucinations and what to expect.  If ever I take trips now its usually about a quater of a tab at a time.

One good thing about trips is the ability for hand-eye co-ordination.  I have learnt some of my best tricks whilst tripping.

Thanks for reading this (if you did)










Trust me, if you eat a LITTLE before you drink the codeine solution (it is bitter but not at all as bad as this guy says it is) you won't have a problem.  Also, once you grow used to taking it, codeine very rarely upsets your stomach unless you happen to be allergic to it (alot of ppl say that they are but are not. They are simply afraid of the nausea it can produce when first starting out with it).  I have taken far more than 300 mgs. of the stuff at a time and don't have any problems with it......and oooooooooohhhhhh what a feeling!!!!  It is a warm, cozy, calm feeling that simply cannot be produced by pot or any other drug (except for other opiates!).  It is my absolute FAVORITE drug of choice!  I get a pretty much unlimited supply of tablets containing codeine and tylenol (they are called Empacod).  

Anyway, Empacod has 20 mgs. of codeine per tablet in it and that is a VERY high amount of codeine to be able to get without a script!  I just use the procedure outlined in the FAQ here in the Vaults about getting rid of the tylenol (each tab also has 500 mgs. of tylenol which they call paracetamol overseas).  The finished product is called 'jungle juice' in other countries and I LOVE IT!!!  Just drink it down and enjoy the BEST high of your life baby!!!!!!!!  And by the way, it last much longer than 1 hour, but the really EXTREME high lasts anywhere from 30  minutes to 1 hour.  I HIGHLY recommend codeine as a perfect recreational drug!









I had taken shrooms twice before, and only really felt quite stoned, never really a real trip. This time, I got my hand on a considerable amount of these ultra potent Psilocybe subaeruginosa shrooms that had been circulating around campus. I had heard a lot of people talking about the intensely bad trips this shit had given them, but I decided to take as much as humanly possible anyway. . . the night before was our cross-dressing ball, and I had gotten really drunk and spent two or three hours throwing up, so I was still feeling pretty weak by the time we got around to taking the caps, around 7:00 on saturday night.  The shrooms hit me within about ten minutes, which is in my experience extraordinarily fast, and I was on a completely different plane of reality in about half an hour.  About five or six of us crawled into a tiny, dark room and started entertaining ourselves by playing with pens, laughing hysterically, and trying to talk to a person made out of a pile of clothes. After this, the religious experience began.

It began when a few of my friends went out into our common area and all just started resting on each other. Everyone became increasingly relaxed and mellow, and big smiles appeared on everyones faces.  I felt it necessary to write one of my friends an email about this philosophy that we were developing:


It's not a question of finding the drugs. that is in fact irrelevant. This way of thinking about things. It's not important. The irrelevance of such things as the things can be trippy if we let them be. That's all we need to remember. things can be trippy if we let them be. All we need to remember is that consequences are not necessarily the products of their corresponding actions, and we needn't worry about them in any case. It doesn't matter. . .it can be done later. Society has attatched a negative stigma to statements like this, but this is in fact the very thing wrong with society. These fundamental thoughts are hard to deal with. It requires first the thought that man cannot himself understang everything, being a product of everything. we cannot study the nature of this everything. . .the universe, if you will. It is here. 

Study is pointless. This conclusion has amazingly profound consequences. Science is bullshit. It doesn't matter. We can study ourselves, and only ourselves. Look inward, because that really is all that exists. External reality doesn't. We ex[perience it, but we are in the final analysis a product of it, and so it pointless to bother dealing with it. Oh shit I think I'm going to puke but it doesn't really matter. The puke is there. It could be in my stomach, or fucking all over the place. It doesn't matter. It exists. This is my theory of religion with respect to vomit:.I'll probably die just in a few years anyway, but that entirely without importance. I'll be part of what I came out of. THIS IS FUCKING IMPORTANT. But its ok. I think i can handle this. holy shit when you see this.. . . .... .wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. But treat as you like. Do NOT fucking delete it cause I want a fucking profound-ass copy.


This way of feeling permeated everything.  I went outside, and me and my friends all lay on top of each other, maybe about eight of us or so, and we collectively attained a level that I truly believe that siddhartha gautama described as 'nirvana.' I had absolutely no sense of my self.  I was as much the people that I was lying on and holding hands with as I was myself.  I looked at a table, and became a table.  I looked at Jessica, and became jessica.  I was completely happy, completely content. Everything was simple.  I did not care about anything in the material world.

Of course, right now (the next day), while I can describe what happenned, I can't really comprehend it. While I know I was in a state of self-less bliss, I no longer remember what it felt like.  The feeling of loss is quite painful, and I've been spending quite a long time trying to figure out what to do with my life. I'm not sure anymore if I'm going to stay in college.  I might just start walking and see where I end up. But I'm sure that this experience was for the best.  These shrooms showed me a goal, showed me a way of thinking that I think I could attain again without drugs, through belief and prayer. . . Or maybe I'm overanalyzing. But I really do believe it's possible these drugs have changed my life for the better.

PS: Don't do dramamine. It is the embodiment of evil.








I found out that my friend was going to be getting some ecstacy. I had never tried it, and I was a little hesitant about trying it at first. I had previously just stuck to weed, and this seemed to be a bit more of a hardcore drug. I eventually decided to drop, and drank it down with some orange juice. One of my friends had dropped an hour before me, so he was beginning to turn on when I dropped.

Right after I droppped, we smoked a bowl. I was told this is one of the best ways to take it. It clams you down for an hour until the drug begins to take hold, so as you begin to go from high to stoned, the drug turns on. It was indeed a very smooth and enjoyable transition. 

About an hour later, I was sitting in my friends room getting ready to go out, and I began to turn on. The first feelings were weird and disorienting. I did not have trouble focusing on things when I kept my head still, but when I moved it, things went a little blurry (if you have ever seen Go, the part when the guy first starts turning on the apartment illustrates this feeling well). We then went out to go walk to a party. As we walked, the cool winter air felt good on my skin, like a hot summer day when you open the freezer. I lit up a cigarette, and the smoke felt good going down and back up my throat. I could barely even feel the smoke, but the motion of the air was nice.

Then it really began to hit me. My clothes began to feel good against my skin. I went up to my friend who had recommended that I try the drug, and just yelled, 'Eric, aaahhhh!' I had no other way of telling him what was happening to me, but he knew exactly what I meant. It was an incredible feeling. We went into the party, and when we went out to the dance floor, I was incredibly drawn to the energy of all of the people dancing. I made me happy that all of these other people were having a good time, laughing and dancing. I loved it.

Some of the people I was with were asked to leave, so went to another party where some of my other friends were. Soon would come the high point of my experience. I told some of my friends at the party that I was rolling, and one of them insisted that they do an airplane to me. I had no idea what this was, but it sounded interesting.

They took me into a room that was carpeted, and the one guy began to 'blow me up.' He He moved his hands all around on my face, chest, shoulders, and back. It felt very good. He then said to fall back when he told me, and I did. It felt like I was falling back into a pillow. Another friend picked me up by my legs, and they began to swing me back and forth in the air. I felt like I was flying. They then began to slowly let me down to the ground, and when I was on the ground, my friend blew me up again. When he did this the second time, I had no knowledge of my body. All I could feel were the spots on my face where my riend was touching me. It was like I only existed where I was being touched. After he finished, I just lay there for a minute, and when I opened my eyes, they were all these people looking down a tme. I just looked up and smiled, thinking to myself, 'If you only knew.'

I got up and began to rub my hands up and down my arms and hips and chest, because my clothes felt good against me. I loved it. Textures were awesome. I especially liked sweaters, becase they were soft but a little rough. I found myself shaking everyone's hand and feeling their arm as I wlaked away. I just wanted to touch everyone and feel everything. I went and sat down, and just felt my girlfriend's down jacket for about fifteen minutes while talking to some people. I was sitting next to a friend of mine (who had rolled before) and said, 'Dude, I'm not gay or anything, but your jeans feel good.' He just laughed. He knew.

Soon after, I began to come down because my gilrfriend had dropped as well, but it never kicked in for her. Overall, from the time it turned on until the time I began to come down, it was only an hour, but seemed like an eternity. It is definitely something I would do again.








The headline in the paper said 'local teen claims he is god.'  The article read that a local teen alledged of been on LSD was arrested for disruption of peace, disortly conduct, resisting arrest, and a whole other list of what seemed to be petty charges.  But the article forgot to mention a few details. And I know because I was there, it happened at my house.
My boyfriend, three of his friends, and I went to a party and bought some acid.  Each of us had taken two purple gel tabs.  All of us except for one of my boyfriends friends had taken gel tabs before.  James had only tripped one time and it had been off of one hit of blotter.  

My boyfriend and his friends headed back to our house and me and one of my girlfriends went to Perkins to get something to eat.  We had just gotten oiur food and I was starting to feel sick.  My friend said that I looked kind of pale and I went to the bathroom and threw up.  Before I puked I hadn't started tripping, but as soon as I walked out of the bathroom my buzz majorly kicked in.  I didn't feel sick any more and I felt really good.  On my way home I was seeing really awesome chasers off the stars.  I thought it was going to be the best trip that I had ever had.  I was going to find out very soon that I was wrong.  

I got back to my house and started to watch T.V. The boys were in the kitchen doing something.  My boyfriend told me that he and one of the other boys were going to go get something to eat and that they would be back. (Note:  I was Trippin' I forgot that he told me that.)  So they leave and I go in the kitchen with Jeremy and James (the two friends that were still there.)  Now I had tripped a few times before this and I had never had a bad experience with acid.  I always had a really good time and I laughed a lot. Even the first time that I did it, and the same with all of my friends that had done it.  (and we were not big drug doers.  We smoked weed and that was it.)  

So James seems to be getting kind of uneasy.  And he asked me 'Where did Mike go?' (Mike was my boyfriend)  and I told him that I didn't know.  And he asked me if I was worried about him and I told him no.  So about five seconds later James asks me the same question.  So I give him the same answer. Jeremy noticed that James was acting kind of funny so he told him that Mike went to the store and that he would be right back.  (because we forgot where he told us that he went.)  So James starts to get really weird.  And he looks right at me, almost like he was looking in me and he askd me 'is this the truth?'  and I had no fucking idea what he was talking about.  And I just looked at him funny.  Because it wasn't that he was asking me if Mike really went to the store, I didn't know what he wanted to know.  So them he gets real excited and he says , 'We're tripping on acid.  We're tripping on acid!'  And then we asked if this was reality.  I told him that it was and that we were just tripping and everything was okay.  So he was like, 'I like you.' And I told him that I liked him to.  And he said, 'No.  I don't think you understand.  I like you.'  So I got the hint and told him that that was very nice of him to say but that I already had a boyfriend.  And he wasn't satisfied by that.  He was like, 'Just tell me that you like me.' And he gave me this really evil look and I shit you not he drilled into my head and asked me, 'where is Mike then?'   and I got really scared then and I yelled. 'I told you that I didn't know!'  and he got really quiet and he said 'Mike is dead.'  and I was like 'No, that's stupid.' but since I was tripping I started to think about it and it did seem like he was gone for a really long time and we were all tripping, so I started to get worried.  But then I was like no way.  But James was convinced and he kept looking at me asking me the same question in my head. (now I don't know anything scientific about this, but once my boyfriend told me that if two people are tripping that they can talk to each other and not say anything.  

Up until that point I thought he was full of shit, but I swear on my life and I swear to this day that James and I were going back and forth, and not saying anything out loud.)  So I'm starting to freak out now.  Yelling to James, in my head, to shut the fuck up and leave me alone.  And then he says with dead serousness, 'Mike is dead and you're my girlfriend now, and this is my house.'  and Jeremy finally speaks up and says, 'no, this is not your house.  And there are two other roommates upstairs who aren't tripping who are trying to sleep.'  And then James told Jeremy that he looked like a vampire and told him not to talk anymore.  I looked at James, and I mean this was the first time that I realized that I was looking at him and he looked like he was dead.  He was really tall and skinny and his face was almost a yellow color and his lips were purple and his eyes looked really blank.  So I said that I was going to go upstairs and go to sleep.  I got halfway up the stairs and James grabs my arm and drags me back into the kitchen.  He sits me down in a chair and tells me that I'm not allowed to move.  And then he puts his arms around my head, almost like in a headlock, and starts breathing really heavy.  I was like fuck this and I got up and I ran up the stairs. (like in the scary movies when the girl goes up the stairs when she should really leave the house.) And I go up into my girfriend Meg's room, and I tell her to lock her door. 

All of a sudden I hear this like crashing downstairs and I'm trying to explain to Meg what was going on.  The I hear James making all of these sex noices and he was yelling my name.  Now up until this point this boy had barely spoken to me.  He was always very quiet and polite.  Then he was yelling, 'where are you?  I can feel you.' and a few more explicit things that I don't care to go into detail about.  And then I heard a bang and I heard him coming up the stairs.  He went right to Meg's door and started pounding on it.  Demanding that I come out.  He got down on the floor and was sticking his hand undre th door going ,'Oh, I can feel you.  Let me in!'  I by this point was sitting on the bed bawling, but trying to be as quiet as I possibly could and just praying that the whole thing was just a bad dream and that it would be over soon, or that Mike would come home, or anything.  And I wanted to put my head right through the wall.  We wanted to call the cops, but we didn't have a phone in the room.  Finally James was making so much noise that our other roommate woke up.  And we heard him come out of his room and go, 'Dude what the fuck.'  And James said, 'I'll suck your dick.'  and our roommate started swearing and then we heard this big rukus in the hall.  Meg opened the door a crack and then shut it really quick.  She said, 'OH my god.  He is buck naked.'  I guess he tried to grab our roommate and our roommate tackled him to the floor and beat the hell out of him.  Then our roommate called the cops and told us not to come out of the bedroom until the cops got there.  Like that was an option.  James continued to lie on the floor and scream out my name until the police got there.  When they got there they brought an ambulance.  James trold the cops that he didn't care what they did to him because he was God and he created everything.  And he kept yelling that he had figured 'IT' out and htat he was the smartest man alive.  The cops thought that it was kind of funny.  I didn't.  They finally took him out in a straight jacket.  Just as they were taking him out Mike and his friend came home.  Mike said that James was screaming about how he had figured it out and then yelled to Mike that he wasn't gay.

A policeman came to talked to me and there was no way I was going to tell him what really happened, so I just told him that I was sitting at my house and Jmes just walked in and started flipping out.  And the cop said, 'well I heard there was some LSD going around.'  (thanks for the tid bit officer.)  So after everybody was cleared out I went to the bathroom and threw up, again.  And I just laid in my bed and cried until I went to sleep.  To this very day James is not the same.  In fact now he's referred to around town as Crazy James.  I don't live in the town anymore and I don't usually like to tell people about what happened, but in a small town everybody knows everything anyway.  A year later I did acid again.  And I was fine.  After the whole thing happened I went online and looked up everything that I could find about LSD.  I read a book called 'Using LSD to heighten the Buddhist Tibetan Experience' and it tells you how to prepare for using LSD and how to calm someone down who is having a bad trip.  What I've learned in all my experiences with LSD (because this was not the first bad trip that I've seen, but definitely the worst.) I've come to realize an important lesson.  A weak mind can't handle a strong drug.  You have to be totally comfortable with who you're tripping with.  And just have fun don't be scared.  Now as far as talking without saying anything...it hasn't happened since, but if it does happen to you just hope that it somebody that you feel okay about it happening with.  And be careful.

Act I, Scene 1       -- Coming Up (12:30 am)

(+0:00)  I snort 32 mg (0.213 mg/lb.) of 2-CT-7 on an empty stomach (it is not clear whether a full stomach will dampen effects) the burn is comparable to the burn when snorting DPT.  I remember to snort correctly and not inhale the powder down my throat; this helps prevent the drip taste (which I personally dislike).  I begin the trip feeling nervous about having too large a dose.  There are only a few reports of snorting 2-CT-7 and here are their thoughts on the matter of dosage:


            ___       _______                   ____
    Subject  A  tried  15     mg and recommends  10 as a starting dose.

(+0:04) I begin to feel the start of the extremely quick rush upwards. This quick rush, which is peculiar to snorting, has the tendency to cause nausea.  (+0:05) I'm experiencing dry heaves; the toilet begins to melt in
bright rainbowy patches so confusing I can barely see.  (+0:10) A friend
leads me to a room with a bong.


Act II, Introduction -- A Primitive Point of View

10-15 minutes after dosing I lose complete track of time.  My trip begins to take on a feverish dreamlike quality with oscillations between social/happy times and darker/introspective times.  From this point forward I will attempt to relate these events in the order that I remember them happening.  I will try to differentiate between my own 'internal scenarios' and 'what everyone else saw.'

Act II is a collection of five scenes that each relate a different
scenario that played through my head during the 2.5-3 hour peak.  I am led
into a social room with a large bong circulating.  I am sat down.


Act II, Scene 1 -- Paranoia

Paranoia seemed to be one of the two main themes that the trip would oscillate between.  The alternate theme is covered later in Act II, Scenes 2-4.  After the initial shoot up onto the peak plateau I was tripping so hard that I couldn't communicate.  This feeling of paranoia would visit periodically through much of the peak.  For much of the peak time, I couldn't effectively use any of my senses.  However, my senses were giving me plenty of input and it was undistorted in many ways, but this was almost useless information because my mind would interpret it so quickly and perhaps recklessly, making conclusions confusing and unpredictable. This interpretations were sometimes startling when paired with very clear sensory input.  The first case of paranoia that I remember was when I couldn't communicate with a very good friend of mine.  I could move my mouth and speak, but I didn't want to communicate because I was scared that if I talked I would give someone else an advantage with this precious information that I would share.  

I felt that I was a cellular organism and the people around me were likewise cellular organisms. To share information was going to dry out my cell as if I would lose H2O at the same time. This was a very scary, competitive environment to be in for a while.  I would be walking around and then suddenly I would be surrounded by a swarm of smiling red faced people that I didn't know.  I then come upon the realization that I could function in a social group and within these groups there are things such as sharing, trust, safety, and compassion.  This would often be the realization that would bring me back to happier, more social times with friends.


Act II, Scene 2 -- Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.

This scene is characterized by my lack of communication with my surroundings.  The things that come to mind is particularly obvious to me that I would not have thought of if I were not tripping.  These are not ideas that I agree with or even agreed with while tripping.  These ideas were my environment as I tripped and as such weren't debatable.  I will narrate the rest of this scenario through my eyes as I tripped: A cattle-like man with bulging muscles is sitting on his chopper as the exhaust pipe is chugging and blowing smoke.  He is an efficient machine. A large and raw (no skin) cattle muscle is in some sort of machinery and it is efficient.  Pain has nothing to do with efficiency or logic.  The efficiency of this machine cannot be argued, but even though there are many people who benefit and live easier because of this machine, there are those who are the muscle.  These cattle provide the necessary balance for all of the good times that are had by their counterparts who live 'the good life' and who promote efficiency. 

A large bong lands in my lap.  I take a big hit.  I am taking a hit off of the tailpipe of a Harley.  The raw cattle muscle begins to get dirty and sooty from my tailpipe smoke.  I think that I might be dirty, sooty, and efficient (in some mechanical way).  I am the Harley rider, taking hits off of a chopperbong, getting my efficient, ripped, skinless cattle muscles sooty.


Act II, Scene 3 -- Time

This scene took place basically when I was close to completely deprived of my senses -- disassociated. As time went on, many different thoughts would pop up into my mind and I would immediately start following logical paths from these different original thoughts, which were probably initiated by sparse sensory input.  Quickly making logical conclusions (arguably assumptions) would lead to further simplifications.  These simplifications would probably not be possible without the speedy and relentlessly numbing mentality available on 2-CT-7.  Every new idea was being logically reduced down to one inconsistency.

Half of space was filled with black and half with white.  An infinitely small sparkling colorless line separated these half-spaces.  This vertical line/plane was the inconsistency.  However, I couldn't tell what this mysterious inconsistency might be.  It was related to some idea of time,   and that idea of time was stopping me from making any further logical simplifications.


Act II, Scene 4 -- Mind Control

I felt as if I were guiding my mind through different tones of thinking.  I felt as I had to work at dodging ideas that might scare me. Thoughts led to other thoughts and often for no apparent reason.  There was an overwhelming feeling that before this trip was over I would have to   experience every gradient in the range of consciousness.  I remember being scared of (1) having to experience being more scared than I could presently imagine, (2) being totally rejected by my social circles, and (3) dying. I viewed this with a disappointed but resolute attitude toward bearing the blows.

It was easy to suddenly have violent mood swings because of certain fickle tendencies on some very basic emotional ideas.  I would be following an enjoyable train of thought.  I could change a small idea in a concept fundamental to that train of thought.  This small change would change the overall composition of the entire thought so that it might no longer be enjoyable.  These rules that I am thinking about and now writing down were just rules by which I remember thinking as if by reflex while tripping through the peak.  Needless to say, I didn't have much control over where my mind would go and I'm glad that I was mostly around people that I really trust and enjoy because most references -- social, logical, temporal, and sensory -- were unavailable.


Act III, Scene 1 -- The Comedown

After 4 hours of tripping I was able to effectively communicate with the people around me.  Before this I could only mumble and speak incoherently. Very tired and mildly irritable, I lie down and try to fall asleep.  My body feels worn and tingly.  I took 9 mg of melatonin to fall asleep.  This 32 mg dose of 2-CT-7 was extremely intense and I recommend snorting 8 mg for a reasonable, enjoyable trip.








I had just made up with a close friend of mine.  I'm not talking about one of those oh it lasts a week, or even just a month thing... I'm talking about a 5-6 month estrangement.  And I had just 'turned my life around' coming off of a near suicide depression.  Well, she wanted me to try Ecstasy with her for the first time for New Years.  We ended up going to this club to get it, because our dealer was going to be there.  She, I'll call her Nikki, convinced me to buy one for that night too.  So for the steep price of $50, I got two hits of ecstasy.  We ate one of the pink triangles, and saved one for new years.  It wasn't setting in, and we had already smoked enough pot that we were so messed up it didn't matter anyways.  We met up with a friend, and he asked us what we were on.  Being funny, we said nothing.  And then with big puppy dog eyes, asked him if he would give us anything for free.  He handed us two pills of ecstasy!  We both swallowed away... it was 2 for my first time!  About an hour after swallowing the first pill, and 15 minutes after the second, it set in!

I needed to squeeze something, and my jaw started clenching, but the warmest, most wonderful feeling in my whole entire life came over me.  I sat in a big heap of people - there were four of us, nikki, me, the guy who gave us the free pill, and another friend of ours who had recently 'hated me'.  We just sat and clutched each other, massaging each other's hands and rubbing each other's backs while silmultaneously hugging.  Don't ask me how we did it - sober, I couldn't remember.  

IT was an insane night.  I could barely speak, I felt so warm and wonderful.  This immense feeling took over me, a feeling that wanted to bond and love everybody.  I wanted to talk the night away!  And I danced and danced and danced!

Since it was my first time, and it was 2 pills, the feelings didn't go away for about 24 hours.  The plateu lasted forever, and the 'coming down' happy bubble period, as I call it, always lasts the next day as well.  But it hasn't lasted as long as it did the first time, nor as strong.  Then again, I haven't done 2 pills together since :)









As many know yabba is not widely available in Europe and in general the Western world. We got our tiny friends in Southern Thailand - out on the Islands.

Having been warned by other travellers and locals that Yabba when ingested can be a 3 day event, and can cause some pretty seriously strong E/Acid effects we desided to do what had been suggested and smoke it. The tablets we got were small  and red - probably half the size of your average E, I chased (on tin foil) a 1/4 of a tablet - the smoke was easy to take and almost tasteless - the hit came on in just a few minutes. I find it hard to discribe the mind set - it was kind of like doing coke without the raring to go feeling, I felt good about myself and had the felling of well being and control, also talkative and alert. I had no adverse feeling at all and felt high for at least a couple of hours - around 3 hours later I smoked another 1/4, I could still feel the 1/4 I had taken earlier on, however once I had smoked the next quarter I realised I had come down more that I had 1st thought and the original high came on very quickly and was stronger, it was again strong for at least 3 or 4 hours.

Yabba is an interesting drug - I didn't fancy ingesting it and from the carnage I saw in Thailand probably better to smoke unless you fancy a few days on the go!







Although for the past 5 years I have been an avid recreational drug user, my first and only experience smoking DMT was enough to prevent me from using hallucinogins to this day, after those intense 20 minutes I believed I had seen it all . . . though that could change someday.

I've eaten mushrooms, mescaline, LSD, peyote and taken more pills of MDMA than I could ever hope to count, but the 'experience' of smoking DMT bypasses each and every one of those  . . . you really need to sit down for this one.

It was about 4 AM and myself and 10 of my best friends were partying still, we had been taking pills of Ecstasy all night. I was with a bunch of hippies, and the common vibe was very relaxed. As we were talking, the topic of conversation turned to a spiritual note, and the subject of Ayahuasca use among Peruvian Indians and its similarity to a near death experience captivated me. Well, my friend turns to us and says 'Well we could all smoke some D right now.' The hippies were all about it, they were veteran users and convinced me that it was going to be the most beautiful and spiritual experience of my life . . . considering I was on MDMA I was all about the empathetic vibe and trying something new, after all, I was with the people I felt most comfortable with in my life, I would be fine.  I was not ready for what was in store.

I had the first hit, and as they told me to inhale as much as I could and hold it in, my lungs of steel took in the whole pipeful. I exhaled and a huge cloud of smoke escaped. 'Uh oh. . .' was my only thought, that was a lot. About 20 seconds later, a tingling feeling rushed through my body straight up from my toes to my head. A colorful, geometric pattern fell over my vision of everything in the room, 'not so bad,' I said. My friend was talking me through it, asking if I was alright, sure, it was pretty and I felt a mild rush of euphoria. Then, I was no longer in the room, all I saw was similar to static on television, with one of my friends in front of me melting into a platinum blob, and reforming into . . . I dont know, an alien, with 2 black holes for eyes and no mouth or nose, or really a face for that matter. When he spoke, I felt as though he had just swallowed me whole and spit me back out, and the words made no sense, they were echoes. I tried to speak back, to tell him to stop swallowing me and spitting me out, but they say I just stared the whole time, never saying a word. 

I closed my eyes to make the craziness go away, but that only proceeded to cause myself to begin falling through space, not knowing which way was up. Opening my eyes, I was no longer in my body, and a rush of random images flashed at me. I was being propelled through time and space, and I honestly felt like I was dead and what I was seeing was a reflection of my life, or human life in general, and a higher power was showing me how delicate life is and how small a piece of existence I am. . . it was bizarre and yet somehow all made sense. 

Now I was back in a room, but I still felt as though I was outside my body, looking back at myself. The room was not the one I was sitting in, but more of a black space, and surrounding me were my friends, but when they spoke, they morphed back into the aliens, and now all ten of them with their black eyes and platinum bodies were alternately swallowing me and spitting me out! Asking me if I was OK, their voices merged into whispery echoes, I tried to speak back, but I thought I was dead and couldn't talk or move.

Fifteen minutes had passed, and I was gradually coming back to a more realistic setting. I could see everyone sitting in a circle around me, but the rainbow geometric pattern was back over everything again. The voices continued to echo around me and I was still sure I was dead and my alien friends were trying to decide what to do with me. Next thing I know, everyone gets up and walks through a black doorway, they were just going downstairs, but I thought it was the 'other side,' which may be considered heaven or hell to some, but I, on the other hand haven't quite decided what it is yet. All I know, is that when my best friend pulled me up to stand and walk toward the door, I hesitated, telling him I wasn't ready, I couldn't go through the door and leave my life behind! He laughed, realizing I still had no clue about what was going on, and led me down the stairs. I went willingly, because I didn't want to be left alone. At the bottom of the stairs what I saw was my friends, sitting around a table, and I realized it was over, I made it . . . but I felt changed inside.

My description of what happened to me that night, is not even close to the actual experience. Words could never completely describe it. Every pyschedelic visual I had ever had prior to this was a definite distortion of reality, but I had never completely, meaning, mind, body, and spirit, ever completely left reality and saw what I did that early morning. I still feel to this day that smoking DMT changed my whole vision about what life is, and although it was the most intense experience I may ever have, (and I do not desire to ever do it again) I do not regret one second, it was a journey that expanded my mind and let me see another side of existence. (Ever seen the movie The Matrix ? it is a reminder of many things I saw, bizarre yet it all made sense)







I tried Nutmeg about two years ago, shortly after obtaining my copy of the Psychedelics Encyclopedia. It was a weekend, so there was no worry about being messed up for work the next day. I sat down and swallowed two large spoonfuls of ground nutmeg. I have since read other articles here, and people suggest mixing it with something like chocolate or milk.....take their advice. trying nutmeg straight is like swallowing a mouthful of bleach soaked saltine crackers....you can't produce any saliva, and it tastes like chemicals.

I felt no effects for quite some time. I remember thinking that this was a bogus drug. and then it hit. I had a pretty harsh case of tinnitus (ringing of the ears), my vision was a little out of focus, and my concentration was for shit. not pleasant in any way. My only hope was the ride would be over soon. It wasn't.

I finally got to sleep about 10 hours later (about 8 hours after laying down to TRY to sleep it off). for the next two days I felt nausea and headaches wrack my body. eventually, by late in the second day of hangover, I was feeling well enough to eat and I finally slept deeply enough to feel rested.

nutmeg is not something I will try again in the future, unless I WANT to feel the worst hangover in my life repeated again and again.







A few weeks ago my boyfriend overdosed on GHB. I was utterly terrified at the events that proceeded. 

THE EVENING
We had just settled in after I got home from work just to hang out and watch a few movies, nothing special. The new guy from work stopped by our house to drop off my waitress apron I had left there. He hung out with us for a bit, smoked some weed and asked if anyone would like some GHB. I refuse to drink the stuff under any circumstances because I have seen too much of its bad effects on girls, my boyfriend on the other hand will do anything offered to him and accepted the boy's offer. The bottle he had contained liquid that was the same color as Mountain Dew, (he had tinted it with food coloring to keep it from looking like water). My Boyfriend had had G before, once he had a small vial of about 1 gram, and another instance where he had about 4 capfuls. Both times he was in a good mood, and felt no unpleasant effects. The boy gave him about two cups (if one had put it into a measurung cup) in a plastic cup and gave us no indication of how strong it was or how much to consume. One of my girlfriends that was there had one cap, and another of our roomates 4 caps from the bottle he had with him. My boyfriend did not use a bottle cap to dose it and drank out of the cup. My girlfriend became very dissociated within 20 minutes or so, and went to lie down, falling into a sleep we could not wake her from, our other roomate fell ill in about 25 minutes and became violent and behaved as if he were drunk.

My boyfriend felt nothing at all and continued to drink out of the cup. He drank about half of it before he felt anything at all. We went in to his room so I could give him a back rub because he said he felt like he was rolling (like he had taken ecstacy). He felt very giddy and drunk, and not at all unpleasant, and dispite my concern and numerous protests he drank the rest of the cup. he told me 'wait 20 minutes, you'll see, i'm fine' 

THE OVERDOSE
Well 20 minutes later he disappeared from reality. We were doing what couples do when he started talking out of his head, saying disgusting and nonsensical things to me. I turned on the light and told him to get dressed but he kept laughing and mumbling to me, flopping around on the bed. At first I thought he was just trying to freak me out until he started drooling and making weird noises, and kept grabbing me and kind of wrestling with me. I tried to dress him but couldn't, I'm very small and he is rather large. His breathing became shallow and heavy and his eyes  had pinpoint pupils and kept rolling back in his head. He was twitching and couldn't make sense when he talked.

Terrified, I went and got his roomate who's seen all kinds of OD's (an ex EMT) and we tried to get him into the bathroom to make him puke. He asked me 'how much did he take' and I said 'he drank all of it'.

Laine told me he could easily die from a dose that big and we had to make him puke before he absorbed any more of it. He couldn't walk or open his eyes and he didn't know his name. Laine put a chair next to the bathtub and we draped my boyfriend over it by his tummy. The pressure of his body made him vomit profusely. we then doused him with freezing cold water to wake him up , which only made him violent. he tried to hit me and and yelled and swore and threw up again. After he threw up the last time he passed out.
 
We took him to his bed and laid him on his side. we took his blood pressure and kept an eye on him. We were afraid to take him to the hospital because the cops would search our house. He twitched for three hours, comatose, then woke up and started throwing up again. He was fine  other than the nausea but remembered nothing from the whole night.

I guess he didn't realize how lucky he was to be alive.







After reading all about dimenhydrinate on the web, I thought it sounded like fun so, me and a friend tried it out the other day.  I recently robotripped for the first time, and thought it was fun, so I figured I should try the dramamine.  We both ate 12 motion sickness pills with 50 mg dimenhydrinate each, then smoked a bowl.  It seemed like just after we were don smoking, the pills kicked in.  Everything started to feel funny, and I was very tired.  We ate a couple caffeine pills to stay awake.
Now I was really fucked up.  Everything was moving, sort of like a weak acid trip, and I kept hearing voices in the distance.  I dont know if I was just hearing shit, or if there were really people talking far away and my perceptions were just increased.  I noticed with the visuals, I could almost see the watery fluid in my eye moving around, and I would see faint 'strings' in the air.

It was very hard to concentrate.  My friend and I would talk, and forget what we were talking about right in the middle of the conversation.  We had a sober person with us who would help remind us of what we were talking about.

I was only really fucked up like this though for a few hours.  The trip lasted somewhat longer, but after about 2-3 hours I was able to talk like a normal person and the visual and auditory hallucinations had lessened.  I found it very easy to fall asleep that night and woke up the next morning feeling fine.  I think the next time I'd like to mix it with cough syrup and see how that is.







I believe, in Junior High I had my first DXM trip by taking too many cough medicine pills.  This trip report covers my first intentional DXM trip.

It all started Sunday morning at about 4:00 a.m.  Being an insomniac, I had tried to go to sleep the night before, without success.  I decided I was going to go to school without any sleep, Id done it before and I was going to do it again.  I started to smoke some weed, only a few pinches from my one-hitter and continued to do so, slowly, until about 7:30.  For the past few months, Id been reading about DXM and decided I was going to try it that day.  

At about 8:00 I left for school (class didnt start until 8:45) and went to a nearby drugstore and picked up a bottle of Vicks 44 Cough Formula (the Vicks equivalent of Robitussin Maximum Cough), drank it quickly right before school.  During my first period class, Im not sure if I felt the effects of the DXM, but I definitely felt something (it couldve been the weed).  It was a nice head buzz.  By second period, I was feeling very tired from the night before and I could really feel the effects of the DXM.  During 2nd period, one of our state senators visited our school and we were having a lycaeum in the auditorium so we could ask him questions.

Walking into the school auditorium, I had my first hallucination.  It was partially visible, but the sound was more distinct.  It was very dark, only a few smaller spotlights lighting the stage.  As I walked along the wall I heard a hollow Whooshing sound and out of the corner of my eye I saw a long tunnel.  I jumped and turned to look at it and it was gone.  I found a seat in the third to the last row and the lycaeum began.

By this time, the full effects of the DXM had kicked in.  I sat there and listened, but I couldnt concentrate on what he was saying.  I put my head between my hands and sat there for a minute.  When I looked up, it looked as if I was still looking at the carpet, like the carpet had attached itself to my vision and it slowly went back down to the floor, out of my vision (as if it had slowly melted back to the floor, its quite hard to explain).  Later, the senator picked up the microphone stand to move it out of his way and it looked like his shadow wasnt making the same movements as him.  I watched this for a long time and asked someone sitting by me if they saw anything different, and of course, they didnt.  Throughout the rest of the Lycaeum, I saw several light distortions, a common effect of DXM.  

I left the lycaeum and went to my 4th period class, which was a study hall in the computer lab (the lycaeum took up two periods).  I just sat there and let my mind wander.  It was a very strange experience.  I remember asking myself questions about anything, mostly life in general, and looking for answers.  Then, I looked up and there was a classmate who had a shirt that read Play and pictured a person hitting a baseball, nothing else.  Im not sure if that is what his shirt had really said, but at the time, that is how I had read it.  I stared at that picture which seemed like hours, but after looking at the clock, it was only about 2 or 3 minutes.  After staring at it, I snapped to attention and I suddenly knew EVERYTHING.  Not that I was thinking any more clearer, or had even really figured anything out, but every question I asked myself, I had an answer for.  I had a false sense of enlightenment and I loved it.  Looking back, the answers were totally unrelated, but they satisfied my curiosity for the time being.

After that, I started coming down from the trip.  Throughout the rest of the day I had several small visual distortions.

That night I slept 16 hours and I felt a small hangover from the DXM.  It wasnt a headache, but I felt completely drained of energy and still had the heavy feeling from the day before. 

I would recommend DXM to anyone whos looking for a legal high.  Just get the background information before you try it.










First, let me tell you about myself. I live in Monterrey,Mexico and have a degree in psychology.  Being Mexican, please excuse any glitch in my English.

On September 16,1999 my brother in law and I took a trip to a town called Real de Catorce. This little town is lost in the plains of northern central Mexico and is accesible only through a 2 kilometer tunnel. The area is sacred for the huichol people and they go on a yearly pilgrimage to look for the sacred hicuri (peyote). I was surprised the first time I went there to find many Americans and Europeans living there (this was my fourth trip, but the most interesting one).

Since my first trip I had been very curious about the peyote,but I was a little scared about it. Fortunately on this particular time I met a man called El Camaron (shrimp in English)and we started talking about peyote and he turned out to know a great deal about it. What really convinced my brother in law (his name is Jorge, by the way)and I about trying the peyote was that this man had only good things to say about hicuri. He told us that we would learn a lot about ourselves and that, if eaten with respect and a purpose, hicuri would be good to us and that if our trip was scary,it would be that way for agood reason. So Jorge and I decided to try it.

I think it is important to tell you about Jorge. First of all, he is a great,sensitive guy and we have the best of the friendships, but unfortunately he is not a strong individual, he is a bit clumsy physically and this brought a lot of abuse from other kids when he was younger.We are both thirty-three now. All of what I have told you and some other things made him a little bit insecure of himself. On the other hand,I am strong secure of myself and through my life I have practiced extreme sports and things like that, so for Jorge I am like a big brother.

So we headed into the desert with a local guide and took only what we needed then we went to an abandoned mine and set camp. We ate the peyote with great respect  and just kept talking of ordinary things. About two hours after we ate the peyote Jorge vomited, but we felt normal.

After maybe another hour I was looking up at some tree branches and they started to turn more dense right in front of my eyes, and I thought 'this is it' at the same time the leaves of the trees started to glow like emeralds and everything exploded in a thousand colors and I felt one with the mountains and my surroundings there is one word to describe it:bliss. 

And here comes the learning that the experience gave us,at a given moment I could actually feel terror coming out of Jorge,he did not looked scared at all but his fear was hitting me in the same way as if he were throwing something physical at me,at that time I asked him 'You´re scared shitless, aren´t you?' And he was astonished that I could feel that because he was not showing any fear at all.I suddenly said,and to this day I do not why, 'You are dealing with your past'. This made him very anxious and he told me 'How the fuck do you know all about what I am feeling? How can you be so accurate?'

To tell you the truth I don't know. What I can tell you is that I had an incredible mental connection with my friend and I knew he was in trouble facing his demons, but as the hours went by I talked out of his fears and we started to enjoy a state of mind so beautiful so undescribable that to try to explain it would be like explaining a person who was born blind how is the color blue.At about six am we got into the tent and fell asleep.

The next day Jorge told me 'Now I know that I am capable of achieving many things I thought impossible,if I made it through that night in which I faced my deepest fears I can do anything'.

And so it was. The next day we climbed a mountain and Jorge pitched the tent cut firewood and did things that the previous day he regarded as impossible. As for me the mental connection was incredible and the feelings beautifuly overwhelming,and there is no doubt in my mind that the experience was one of the most enriching events in my life.  By the way, Jorge is now in college and people respect him a whole lot more than before that night in September 16, 1999.







I have one word of advice for X users, and that is to ONLY DO THIS DRUG with people you trust!  I tried X for the first time 2 weeks ago, and although it was an amazing experience, I can see how it would be potentially dangerous if I was not around reliable people who had rolled before.  For the first half hour or so, I felt none of the drug's effects.  But when I hit the 45 minute mark, I was completely gone.  My entire body felt warm and fuzzy, and I kept running my hands over my arms just to feel the sensation.  This lasted for about 10 minutes when the full effects hit, and I freaked out.  It got way too strong; I started sweating, pacing back and forth, and was convinced that I was dying.  I thought, 'I got a bad pill, I'm going to OD on this shit.' I was so out of it I thought I was about to break into millions of pieces and go flying into space.  I didn't even remember that I'd taken anything, and when people tried to explain that it was the drug, I could only hear them through what sounded like a huge tunnel.  

If great friends wouldn't have been around to take care of me, I'd seriously have dialed 911 or (worse yet) my dad in a panic.  Also, while the touchy-feely sensation is definitely one of the ups of X, getting overly physical with someone could have it negatives in the morning.  Again, I'm glad I was with people who were keeping an eye on me and knew what to expect.  So everyone out there, have a good roll, but BE SAFE!!!!







A friend and I decided to spend a saturday afternoon tripping, as usual. We already had some cannabis and salvia, but decided now would be a good time to try 2C-B, the queen of the psychedelic amphetamines which we had heard so much about. Our dealer said that he had some extremely potent pills, so we purchased one pill between us and had half each. We sat in my room and took the 2C-B orally, then rolled up a fat one with some skunk. I put EP7 by Autechre on the stereo. After we had finished the spliff the 2CB started to take hold. We felt something happening to ourselves, but it didn't feel like anything we were used to. I thought it would feel a bit like E when coming up, but it didn't and I started to worry that the pill might have been spiked with something other than 2CB. First I thought it was acid, the most likely contender as far as pill spiking goes. Then I thought, it must be ketamine or PCP because I couldn't feel my arms and legs getting longer like with acid. 

After voicing my worries to my friend (who will be known only as Mr.X) I began to get even more worried. Mr.X started saying how warm and snuggly he felt, and I thought that the pill might have been spiked with smack. But then, it all became clear. If it was smack then I wouldn't have cared what was in it, and it certainly wasn't any other drug I had tried, so it must be 2CB. When I had the thought 'This is 2CB, this is really good' it was like I was standing on a beach and a huge wave of orgasmic pleasure hit me like a wall. I was lying on my bed panting, moaning and rubbing my hands over my whole body uncontrollably. I couldn't believe how intense it was. It made cocain look like speed. 

Then after a few minutes of bliss we calmed down. I felt extremely focused. I knew exactly what reality was, there was no confusion over what was real and what wasn't. I went to the bathroom to get some water and saw some sober flatmates on the way. I spoke to them coherently and felt completely in control of what I was saying. No ecstasy rants. When I came back to the room we decided to let the effects settle in for half an hour. Then we smoked another spliff and got the salvia out. 

I knew that doing bongs of salvia was going to be cool because I had done salvia and E before, and that was mind blowing. This was going to be REALLY good. After the second bong of salvia I got up and sat in my blow-up chair. I felt like I was on a magic carpet flying into infinity. But it wasn't like doing lots of salvia, because I could see my room as it really was, as well as seeing a horizon which I was flying towards. After the first two minutes of the salvia rush I focused my attention on a large psychedelic poster on my wall. The poster is trippy enough as it is, but the salvia and 2CB added a whole new dimention to it, literally. It looked like it was moving around in 3 dimentions. It kept dividing up into layers which moved foward and backward. As well as this, the pattern on the picture looked like lots of strange animals and humans joined together, and flowing through one another. 

After the salvia wore off we explored the effects of the 2CB. I found 'concentration' is very important to the experience. For a start it makes you feel very concentrated on whatever you are doing. But if you actually try to concentrate on something as hard as you can, that is when the interesting things happen. Just by concentrating on a thought about how good someting is, the 2CB fills every part of your being with wave after wave of pleasure far more intense than a sober orgasm. But you can control it at will. You switch it on and off just by willing. If you concentrate on something external to yourself then you can take pleasure in this too. You can stare at something and see it getting more and more beautiful, as the 2CB changes its colour and projects geometric shapes onto it. Music sounds like it was supposed to. Social interaction on 2CB is also very enjoyable, but you don't feel like you love everyone as with E. 

On the whole, I found 2C-B a very versatile and rewarding drug. The best thing about it is that you have so much control over the effects. You can't switch it off completely, but you can easily remember what reality is. The salvia did add a very interesting aspect to the trip. But personally I think that salvia is best taken on it's own, preferable chewed, at least 3 days after taking any other drug, especially cannabis. I may well go without cannabis for a week and then try chewing 10 fresh leaves whilst on 2CB. It's a shame that GOd didn't make salvia and cannabis more compatible.








My suggestion to anyone who is considering taking a maiden voyage on shrooms, is to get some basic info on them first.  I had gone over to a buddy's home just to hang out.  My girlfriend and I were on very bad terms, and I decided that hanging out with the boys would help ease some tension.

Unknown to me, they had purchases about 2g of shrooms for me to experiment with.  They were veteran users and assured me that it would be very pleasurable.  Before this, I had only been an occasional toker. So I tried it, along with a bunch of healthy hoots from my bong.

I washed it down with a few beers and after half an hour nothing seemed to be happening, while all the while I hadn't noticed that I was getting full of energy.  

The first signs came when I went to the washroom to take a piss.  I looked at myself in the mirror, and noticed my pupils enlarging and shrinking like flashing railroad crossing lights.  

I went back into the living room where my two friends were waiting and told them what I saw.  My one friend handed me a picture of a motorcycle and asked me what I saw.  I noticed the traffic behind it in the picuture was moving at an incredible rate.  

Bigger changes occured in the next couple of hours.  A black cat was sitting behind my one friend smoking a cigar for a few seconds at one point.  I was in the kitchen at another time watching popcorn be made with an air popper.  This was fun since the popcorn looked like a waterfall the way it was coming out and I began swimming around the kitchen.

It turned ugly quick as I became violently angry with the one friend since he wasn't saying much to me.  I thought he was up to something and was planning my demise and was the cause of all the world's frustrations.  (Later I realized that this was a venting of the tension between my girlfriend and me).

For most of the trip I was violent, however by reading articles and stories after the fact, I know how to influence the trip to be a more pleasurable one in the future.  Looking forward to it!










It was a few years ago, I was in 9th grade.  I had smoked marijuana for the first time at the beginning of the school year and I was interested in trying something different.  The school dealer offered me crystal meth and I took him up on his offer.  The next day he brought it to school, I paid him $15 and we went our seperate ways.  I waited until after 1st period to snort my first line in the boy's restroom.  It burned, but it really didn't bother me that much.  Since this was my first time doing it, and all my friends hadn't done it before either, I had no idea what to expect.  I waited a few minutes and nothing happened then the whole day went by and still nothing happened.

I was on the track team, and I had learned that the track meet for that day was only for Varsity, and being on JV excluded me from that day's meet.  I then realized that I would have to inform my parents of this, so they didn't drive all the way down to the school where the meet was being held.  I went to the student office and asked to use the phone.  She politely aked why, which was school policy, and I explained that I needed to call my parents to tell them that I wasn't going to the meet.  Unfortunately the asshole track coach happened to be in the office and he overheard our converstation.  He said that he told everyone on the team about the schedule change the day before.  Hearing this the secretary declined my request to use the phone.  This made me extremely pissed off.  Not realizing that Junior High School secretaries are complete morons, I tried to explain as simply as I could how I wasn't at the practice the day before, but they just wouldn't listen.  They just kept on saying that the coach had told everyone the day before, and they didn't seem to care that I wasn't at the practice.  I am not I violent person, and I had never felt such extreme rage in my entire life.  I was ready to jump over her desk and rip her fucking head off, and I would have, but for some reason I didn't.  I just left and on the way out I took a picture off the wall and through it on the ground.  It was not until a while after the incident that I realized the crystal meth had influenced my anger.

When I got home from school, I snorted another line and found that you can't snort just one.  My nasal passages were clear and my energy level was through the roof.  By the time my parents got home (an hour after I had gotten home) I had snorted the whole bag.  After a while, my family had retired to the living room so I decided to join them.  It is probably a good idea to mention that I am a very shy person, and I hardly talk at all.  I must have forgot this after I snorted the bag, because when I put my headphones on I started singing very loudly along with the songs I was listening to.  My parents didn't seem to mind so I kept on singing until I couldn't sing anymore.  The only hallucinations I had was my bedroom door warping, which only happened for a second.  I could hear my dad talking on the phone in the kitchen, but it sounded as if we where in the same room together.

Overall this was an awesome experience.  The main reason why I would not recommend this drug is because it is very addictive.  I did it only a few times after that before I quit for good, but that was only because the one and only meth dealer at my school moved away.  I found myself craving the drug even months after quitting.










I have never tripped before in my life.  I am a freshman in college, 19 years of age.  I have experimented with MDMA and other forms of Ecstasy, MJ, etc.  Nothing hard-core at all.  Went to visit Daniel and he suggested we try these seeds together (both first-timers).  We ate a huge dinner and took the seeds around 11:30 PM.  He had soaked the seeds in water for about three hours and we scraped the brown fuzz off with our fingernails.  We chewed them up and swallowed them.  Tasted like peanuts, not bad at all.  Felt the beginning effects about 15 min. later while walking in Wal-Mart. Found Dramamine and took it. The nausea was no big deal...felt a bit heavy in the bottom of my stomach, but other than that, no vomiting. 
 
12:30 PM- Smacked-out roll feeling.  Generally happy.

1 AM- Went to a deserted beach (Sardis) and I laid on my back feeling as though I could not move while Daniel danced around free-spririted.  Cigarettes were absolutely amazing, admitting bright orange tracers...fascinating visuals that were extremely vivid.

1:45 AM- We walked in the enveloping darkness to the water's edge and felt as though we could walk across the water without any difficulty.  Looked to our left and and we both saw four dark figures walking towards us.  We were overcome with fright and extreme paranoia...stopped in our tracks feeling as though neither of us could move.  We were genuinely scared for about five minutes!  As we were walking along the sand, looking down at it, it appeared to be large canyons, such as that of the Grand Canyon in a way.  I felt as if I was sinking in the sand but could walk fine.  I viewed the below sand as shapes of the world, my footprints causing large pools and lakes in that vast miniature Earth.

2 AM- Began to see holograms around bright objects.  The moon had an aura around it that was beautiful.  We concentrated on car lights moving slow.  There was a distinct iris around the lights consisting of red, green, orange, and yellow.  I held a prism from the lights in my hand and was able to contort it in any way or shape.  It was as though the 'prism' was physically solid and I could touch it and move it.  Quite amazing.

2:30 AM- Attempted to enter a Chevron back in town to buy some water and felt as though everyone was planning a conspiracy against us.  The cashier, I know, was hiding a shotgun under the counter and she looked at me as though she knew everything I had ever done in my life wrong.  She was the devil at that moment.  Intense.  Ventured to the guy's house who had given the seeds to Daniel and I.  Everyone there had eaten their fair share of the seeds.  Daniel and I sat transfixed on the floor watching a poster.  I could turn the poster into any color I wanted and move the figures in all different ways.  Holograms and tracers were still vivid at this point.  Street lights possessed a strange ring of neon blue around them that was absolutely beautiful.  I had never seen such vivid colors and shapes in my life.  Quite strange that Daniel and I were tripping the same visions, etc.  We felt the same always.

3 AM- Felt extremely exhausted for some unknown reason.  Felt the lethargy lurking behind my eyes.  Had a great over-all body buzz still going.  Felt numb in my eyes and especially behind my head towards my neck...almost as though everything 'buzzed.'  We both decided to attempt to sleep.  Walked into a dark room that felt as though it was 1000 feet long.  I was walking into a strange tunnel that swirled around me.  We both layed down and closed our eyes.  I knew Daniel was fine and enjoying the experience.  He mentioned that everything was as a kaleidoscope of visions, shapes, and colors.  I closed my eyes to find that my head would not leave me alone.  I could not reason with any of the thoughts that entered every milisecond.  I was quickly driving myself into a non-reality that I could not get out of.

3:30 AM- Could not stand the insanity any longer!  My thoughts were racing and my mind was eating itself inside out.  I jumped out of bed and ran to the bathroom calling to Daniel.  I began to try and compose myself but failed miserably after I looked at the pattern on the bathroom wall.  The ceiling was rippling, as well as my whole body.  The pattern on the wall was contorting itself in swirls and mixtures of intense colors.  My head buzzed and I could feel hotness in my ears.  My hands were clammy.  I had to get out of there!

3:45 AM- Threw on my shoes and went out in the cold with nothing but my PJs with Daniel.  Walked around in circles trying to reason with my thoughts.  Smoked a lot and figured out that I was definitely in another dimension.  Not even what one would consider a third dimension...this had to be like the tenth dimension of a world that did not even exist.  I knew I was going insane, lost in a world of raw chaos.  I could not get comfortable and I had nothing to ground me.  

4 AM- Daniel and I decided to drive to the next town and back just to get my mind distracted.  I knew he was going through the exact same intensity as I but he later told me that because he was so focused on keeping me from suicide, he remained calm.  I began to see extremely intense visuals and rapid hallucinations.  Splotches would remain within my area of vision for what seemed to be hours and visions were so rapid that I could not focus on just one.  They were ever-changing and constantly distorting.  I could not look at Daniel for more then two seconds because his face and hands would morph into something or someone unrecognizable.  At one point I saw the skin from my fingers melting away replaced by boiling blood.  I looked at Daniel and saw Jesus Christ with a halo.  Later, I realized I was 'peaking,' lasting about one hour.  I kept sticking my feet out the window of the truck and rocking back and forth.  I thought about the padded walls I would soon be visiting as soon as he got me to the insane asylum.  That is where I needed to be.  And I remember thinking that I was NEVER going to come back from this insanity as I kept chanting over and over again,'We have got to do something....we have got to stop this!'  If there is a hell, that was it.  That was hell.  I tried everything.  I wanted to make it beneficial.  I thought about happy things.  I tried to do normal things in a mere attempt to bring myself back down to normality.  Nothing worked. I needed suicide I thought.

4:45 AM- An hour passed and I was recovering from my bout with intense chaotic insanity.  My head ached for rest and my eyes would not close though I was exhausted and drained of all energy.  Everything still seemed as a kaliedoscope and the ripples were still ever-present.  The whole trip was intense and Daniel and I had to wait until 8 AM until we could go to bed.  

I would recommend drinking vast amounts of water to get the 'hell' out your body quicker.  I slept until 5 PM the next day.  We both woke up to a feeling of being 'strung-out' and just generally out of it for the rest of the day.  Hunger returned and eating helped the feeling.  I was fine but still felt the effects of distorted vision.  The back of my head was still buzzing.

Though I experienced what I thought was the most horrible thing in my life, I will never regret doing it.  I will probably do it again.  The experience definitely altered my state of thinking and opened doors to a world of philosophy unencountered.  My thoughts are more vast and mature.  The correlation between thought and word is now clarified.  Many writings will be produced as a result of my experience with HBWR.  I would NOT recommend HBWR to those weak in thought and shallow in mind.  It truly is a journey, a TRIP, to experience.  Be careful with it.  HBWR is not to be fucked with when taken correctly.

I have no basis for comparison but from my experience alone with HBWR, I KNOW it is GOOD.  I was pushed to the edge of sanity and brought back again as soon as I could not handle it.

I remember experiencing alienation, could not catch my breath, dehydration and intense thirst though I could not drink anything.  Music was great and nature was absoultey amazing.  Thoughts were intense as well as vision.
Depression and indifference has folI have never tripped before in my life. 
If you enjoy insantiy, give HBWR a try.  I know that it will soon dissipate but I also know the my reality will never be the same again.  If you enjoy insanity, give HBWR a try!







INTRODUCTION: During the systematic exploration of various agents in the alteration of the perception of consciousness, nutmeg was examined.  Nutmeg is a dried fruit which has enjoyed moderate to widespread popularity throughout history as a spice.  It has a pleasant nutty, minty aroma and a bitter oily flavor  which complements dairy products, root vegetables, lamb, and various other foods.  It is commonly used as a condiment in flavoring coffee.  It is quite bitter when concentrated and thus is not used to make teas, infusions, etc. on a routine basis.  Ingestion of generous portions of nutmeg (one or two teaspoons) in coffee or espresso have seemed to enhance the effects of the caffeine in a positive way.  Based on this, more rigorous examination of nutmeg itself seemed warranted.

METHODS:  Whole dried nutmeg was obtained from a local health food store.  A nutmeg grater was used to reduce several whole fruit to a light beige powder which exuded a dark brown oil when compressed.  The powder was then packed manually into gelatin capsules.  A dose of 200 mg per kg lean body weight was weighed out, comprised of 15 capsules.  On an empty stomach, these were ingested with approximately 8 ounces of water.

RESULTS: 

T + 30 min.: Threshold observed within 30-60 minutes as a subtle alteration in light perception, similar to the narcotized vision of cannabis intoxication.  There is no obvious pupil dilation, confirming the suspicion that this visual change is not typically precursory to psychedelic phenomena.

T + 6 hrs.: At this point the gradual transition between mild visual changes and true intoxication have become apparent; alterations in perception and memory are quite similar to those of a moderate dose of cannabis.  The overall effect is of low-grade Mexican marijuana, but without the unpleasant headache typically associated with such.

T + 9 hrs.: Concentration has become more of a problem than one would expect given the relative lack of visual and auditory distortion.  Still no obvious psychedelic phenomena.  Marked xerostomia.

T + 12 hrs.: This appears to be the peak of the experience.  Strobe light visuals, more familiarly associated with hashish and morning glory use, is readily observed.  Paradoxically, not even the most minimal time distortion or spatial disorientative effect (typically associated with this type of effect) is observed.

T + 13 hrs.: Mild closed eye geometric patterns are seen.  Nothing very impressive.  No psychedelic or insightful phenomena.  Significant tightening of the muscles.  Occasional myoclonic twitches.  There is a hyperawareness of movement; in particular, I am very aware of the beating of my heart, which seems to be a light, cool fluttering.  Careful palpation of the radial pulse and auscultation via stethoscope reveal a normal heart rhythm however.

T + 16 hrs.: A slow drop-off.  Perception has now returned to that approximating moderate cannabis intoxication. Xerostomia still pronounced.

T + 24 hrs.: Still trailing off.  Things seem to have plateaued.  Dry mouth, etc. seems to be relenting, but urinary hesitancy is still marked.

T + 36 hrs.:  Residual clouding of thoughts makes functioning at work suboptimal.  I had not anticipated the effects would persist this long.  Fortunately, they are rather subtle at this point.

T + 44 hrs.: Effects are still present, now mostly as a residual haze -- despite a subjective recovery of mental faculties, thoughts and concentration are still difficult.  Because there is no particular associated psychoemotional euphoria, etc., I find myself impatient for the effects to clear completely.

T + 48 hrs.:  A   v-e-r-y   slow trail-off...

T + 56 hrs.:  Effects now almost imperceptible, although still above threshold.

CONCLUSIONS: 

The drug was well-tolerated, and side effects seemed to be relatively minimal.  There was a significant amount of xerosis (abnormal dryness of the mouth, nose, eyes, etc.) as has typically been my experience with psychedelics, in this case more than with psilocybin but less than with unrefined cannabis.  Clouding of memory and slowed thinking were more pronounced than with psilocybin or other psychedelics and more typical of what one encounters with higher dose cannabis intoxication.  Nausea has previously been reported as a major side effect of nutmeg ingestion, but this was not the case for me.  It is possible that taking the dose in the form of capsules rather than raw powder, etc. helped in avoiding this side effect.  

The overall effect of intoxication was not an unpleasant one, but it was not significantly insightful.  In general, I would say that the effects were very similar to that of moderate dose cannabis ingestion with a few differences. 

1.  There was a slightly 'cleaner' aspect to ascension, similar to that one would expect to encounter with hashish.  The strobe-like visual effects sometimes encountered with cannabis intoxication were present but of a fine fibrillate form. 

2. The psychological and emotional insight one experiences with psychedelics was patently absent here.  While MDMA and 5-MeO-DIPT have exceptionally intense effects on empathy, nutmeg seemed to fall on the other end of the spectrum, having even less emotional impact than LSD, cannabis, or any other such substance.

3. The duration of effect was exceptionally long. The time from onset to peak was 9-10 hours, and, while the effects had largely subsided (to the point where I could interact normally without effort) after 24 hours, there was a persistent 'haze' which lingered for days afterwards. 

4.  The physical side effects of the drug seemed to outlast the psychic effects, specifically urinary retention.

RECOMMENDATIONS:  This substance has little to offer those seeking an enlightening experience, but may be of interest to selected recreational users.  Its excessively protracted effects limit its recreational usage to persons having AT LEAST 24 hours of time to dedicate to the experience.  The extended, non-psychedelic, non-enlightening experience left me feeling a bit impatient, waiting for the physical effects to wear off and allow me to get on with things.  The caveat here is that I have a similar impatience toward cannabis products.  While an avid explorer about 10 years ago, I no longer feel that I learn anything useful from cannabis/THC trips.  

More novice explorers and persons who seek more recreation than exploration may find nutmeg more gratifying.  It is my opinion that better drugs are readily available, making nutmeg more of a novelty than anything else.  As with most who have partaken, I doubt that I will try it again.  Nevertheless, since it is legal, it may appeal to people without access to more restricted substances.  If a slow-to-peak, lingering experience which falls between cannabis and hashish (with a hint of LSD) and lasts for a few days sounds good to you, then nutmeg may be your cup of tea.  Otherwise, stick with using it to flavor your cup of coffee.









I took the about 2 caffeine pills which contained 200mg per tablet. I started at 7:00 AM, I soon peaked at 7:40 AM. I was still only in 1st period of school. I felt the need to want to laugh, and listen and communicate with people. Today I spoke with people without fear and thinking about rejection (I am kinda a shy person). My hands began to shake a little, and twitch. My heard beat increased slightly, I could notice a difference in the beats. I didn't experience any irregular beats though ( which can  happen on caffeine) Time changed to me for some reason. It felt that time was slowed down a little, but I was super speed compared to it. My math teacher would write out notes on the screen and talk to us about them, I felt that she was going so slow. I also became more in tune with my work, answering questions teachers asked(which I never do, kinda annoying).

The peak lasted for about 15 mins. Then I was in 2nd period, I began to have some stomach pains. They weren't bad, but it was annoying. All I wanted to do in 1st and 2nd period of school was move around and talk. I noticed that my walking speed and talking speed increased. I began to feel light headed alittle, not much. I felt I had so much power within my body, like a rocket ready to take off.

I began to come down a little after 2nd period, so I took half a tablet (about 100mg). I thought I would get the same effects, but I didn't. I felt awake and alert. I still have a weird feeling in my stomach. I ate a little bit of cereal with the pill in the morning, I don't know if that was the reason? I thought it would be better with food. I am looking forward to a higher dosage next time. If you want to try caffeine in high dosages make sure you eat something because of the increase in stomach acid. Caffeine can also be very addictive. I drank a lot of water also, I heard from a biology teacher that caffeine removes water from cells?

I have worked in computer shops...tech work..for quite a long time now..and it's a common thing to keep a case or 2 of this stuff on hand.  

When i first started using it, I would get a somewhat nitrous-like experience...distorted sounds, little visuals (i'll let it be known i've not done much nitrous, just a few balloons at concerts etc., so I may not be relating this very well).

OOOH BOY did things start to change.  I mean, I've done shrooms, lsd, all that, but OOOOH BOY

The first sign was a tightening around the temples..and my eyeglasses would seem to move further from my point of view. Things would start to look familiar, but VERY different.

Soon I met ZEB..a quick little 4' mischevious dude, always just running around a corner, and with a devilish laugh that i can still hear.  How did i know his name?  These creatures, they tend to repeat words or phrases in an echoey sort of manner.  Zebzebzebzebzeb..etc.  I remember chasing him around the small office several laps (thank god nobody was there), before saying to myself..ITS NOT REAL.  is it?

He never meant harm, but I swear he wanted to drive me crazy.

Keep in mind, it wasn't during every session that i would trip this hard, but it came in spurts, usually while i was alone, with some sort of background sounds, tv, radio, other voices.

There were others:

Blah : somewhat of an ogre, dimwitted but scary, liked to sing along with van halen

Little green fairies:  when they spoke i was overcome with a sense of joy, peace.  very sentimental to me.  they lived among the empty cans.

The little old lady:  wanted a beer, so did i, but it was working time ;(

The seductress:  always came up behind me..humming softly, soothingly, while I sat or stood facing a wall.  When her mouth came close to my ear and her arms encircled me was the best, and as the buzz wore off she would slip away.  Never got a good look, but long hair, very slight, loving.

I could go on forever here

The sunbeam forcefield, shocked me when i tried to cross it.

Occasional fear of just having swallowed metal shavings

Time frame of buzz : not long, 30sec to maybe 2.5 min..but intense(duh)

I would really love to hear from anyone with a similar experience, I don't do this any longer for fear of damage, but it is really a fond memory..I do not regret it in any way.

This was true hallucination to me, not distortion of reality, but the real thing.  

Had a major trip listening to 'my woman from tokyo' during the funky solo part..tick tock tick tock, everything started moving like a pendulum, too sweet.







i went to visit friends. i took a four hour bus ride to a college in boston, from my teeny-tiny sleepy town, and my first day there was hectic and unfulfilling. i was hoping the next day would be more profitable... i was going to goto a rave and take e for the first time.

it was friday and my friends and i went to get 'supplies'. vitamin C to streamline the trip and increase our health during, gummy worms to chew on and give out, and of course glowsticks. i had just met a super cute guy, a genuine sweetheart, and he let me borrow his sparkley pacifier 'just in case'. (just for kicks we'll call him 'eboi')

it took two hours to get there, and almost an hour to get into the club. we had to stand outside in the freezing rain. and i started to feel really anxious. what if, after i start rollin, i hate it as much as i do pot? what if i curl up into a ball and go into my own person hell for 5 hours? what if i get sick and die? but eboi kept me warm outside and calmed me down. he'd done e over 20 times. i'd be okay.

inside the club i felt stupid. i'd never been to a rave before. i didn't know how to dance. i was terrified of all the people. i didn't know how to act. but eboi said after we started rollin, everything would come to me.

at midnight we rolled. i took a pill called 'tripple stack blue fish'. eboi took a 'mitsubishi'. we sat down against the wall and waited. about some 20 minutes later my stomach hurt like hell and i felt terribly disoriented. i kept feeling sicker and sicker... like my stomach was in a tight ball. i started moaning 'fuck, i'm gunna die...' over and over, and i curled up into a ball in eboi's arms. i was scared to death, thinking my night would be in hell. it was the worst feeling i have ever experienced in my life. i wanted to cry.

just like a speed train it hit me. i sat up and rubbed my face... and looked up to see a new world. the music, before just a bunch of computer generated beats, was alive. the music had a spirit, and my body could feel it's heart beating. i felt enormous waves of pleasure all over my body. i knelt on the floor holding my head, the pleasure over taking me. convulsing in sync with the music, i started howling 'its soooo fuuuccckkkinnng  gooooood!!' over and over, i just couldn't help myself. eboi gave me a big hug and started rubbing his hands all over me: my face, arms, stomach, back. i was fascinated by his bracelets, for no reason at all and then he grabbed my hand and pulled me out onto the dance floor. in waves, the extacy got better and better, more and more. i danced, arms in the air, feeling the music pulse through me. i was so happy i started crying. i danced around in circles, alternately flailing my arms and holding my head in my hands. the waves came more and more. i started going up to people, dancing next to them, asking if they were rolling. i gave out all my candy to people. at one point i found money in my pocket and wanted to give that out too. but eboi made me put it away, which didn't upset me cause i knew i shouldn't give it give it out even though i wanted to. we smoked newport cigarettes (which i usually hate), and it tasted like cool breezes of menthol was radiating thru my body. i danced around the club talkling to everyone who smiled at me. i asked each person if they were happy and if they were having a good time. all i could think about was making sure that every single person i saw was feeling as good as i was. i kept gettting thirsty, and remembering that too much water is bad, i sucked on my pacifier all night. and i poured four dollar water all over myself, just cause it felt good. i talked to eboi about anything that popped into my head, when usually i am pretty quiet. and... i danced for hours.

taking ecstacy at that club was the most amazing and wonderful experience. it was like a journey into heaven. my own version of heaven. i felt overwhelmingly happy, i cared about everyone, i didn't feel alienated or afraid. it was all a warm rush. the instese sickness i felt in the beginning was all worth it, and it served as a wonderful contrast to the full body utopia i experienced shortly after. my favorite part was right after the sickness went away, and i felt what could be described as a full body orgasm. i never wanted it to end. i wanted every moment of my life, from then on, to feel as good as that.

around 4 the effects wore off and i felt damn tired but still very happy and warm, although i stopped talking so much. during the car ride home i sucked on my pacifier and drifted off, wishing i was still rolling, thinking of all the fun i had, and i was going to have again and again...
i never want to do any drugs ever again, none of them come close to how you feel when you're on e. nothing does. nothing.







One night a friend and I were looking to get fucked up, but we were just about broke. I stopped at a gas station to get some chapstick because i'd been doin some crank and my lips were dry as hell. While i was in there i saw a package that said dramamine and i remembered hearing somthing about tripping off of it but there were only twelve in a package so we went to wal-mart and got a big bottle of it for like 3 bucks so we got back to my house and each took 18 pills.  I don't remember excatly how long it was probably an hour, and i saw smoke coming out of the wall. It was pretty cool but then later on we were out in the front yard with all these people that really weren't there.  My mom got up at 1:00 in the morning and my friend was in the bathroom holding a towel talking to the wall, meanwhile i was out in the yard talkin to some of my friends i thought were there. 

My friend thought he had to take these kids home so he left. i was going to go with him but there was no room. So i was by myself sitting in my car and two guys i'd never seen before were sitting in there with me, when i got up and went in the house for a minute,  I came back and one of them was in the drivers seat.  These were some scary lookin motherfuckers, and they were going to steal my car so i woke my parents up at 4:30 saying someone was stealin my car and my dad got up and ran out there. The door was open and the car was running but there was no one around so i made my parents stay up with me.  I could hear them outside talking and i was like do you hear that? they said hear what, the guys are out there i said. They said there's no one out there, but i wouldn't belive them because i saw them and talked to them they seemed so real.

When i tried to go to bed this was around 5:30 is what my dad said. I laid down and looked over and one of the guys that was in the car popped his head up from the side of them bed and said 'give me the fucking keys'. i was like ahhh! My dad came in and looked around, but there was no one there. Finally i went to sleep, but thats not the end of it.

The next morning i woke up and mom said my friends mom had called and wanted to know if i made it home last night. She said yes. She wanted to talk to me but i was still asleep. She told my mom that she had to pick my friend up and he had no memory of what happened. Anyway when he had left to go take those people home he ended up at this house he thought was his aunt's and there was a party going on. This unfortuantly was not the case as it was 5:00 in the morning, and it was an old mans house just down the road. The man came outside and was yelling at him and for some reason he got in the man's car, all the people were still with him he thought. The guy called the cops and they came out and he ran. Of course they caught him because he didn't go very far and he just laid down he thought they couldn't see him even though they had flashlights right on him.

They asked him a bunch of questions like, Have you taken any LSD tonight? He said he didn't know what happened, and they asked him what time it was. He said 10:30-11. They were like, no its 5:30 in the morning son. They released him to his mom and suggested he get drug tested. Cops always have good ideas like that. On the way home he was trying to eat the dashboard in his mom's car, and he thought i was driving. They couldn't find what he had been doing and he insisted he didn't know what happened so he didn't get in any trouble. Good thing the car was full of imaginary people or i would have been with him. It all came out ok and i think it was a good experience but i'll never do that shit again.
